The Planetary Health Accord establishes a multi-layered governance system designed to ensure equitable, transparent, and effective global health coordination. This structure balances the need for coordinated global action with respect for local autonomy, cultural sovereignty, and democratic participation. The governance framework prioritizes meaningful inclusion of marginalized communities, frontline health workers, and future generations while maintaining the agility needed for rapid crisis response.

**Case Study (Real)**: The **African Union's Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)**, established in 2017, demonstrates successful regional health coordination. During COVID-19, Africa CDC coordinated continent-wide responses, including the Partnership to Accelerate COVID-19 Testing (PACT) initiative, which established testing strategies adapted to African contexts. This example shows how regional health coordination can maintain local relevance while achieving continental-scale impact.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: In the **Pacific Health Sovereignty Initiative** (2028-2030), Pacific Island nations established the first Regional Health Hub with full indigenous co-governance. Traditional Polynesian, Melanesian, and Micronesian healing practices were integrated with modern healthcare delivery through Community Health Legions trained in cultural protocols. The initiative achieved 40% reduction in diabetes complications and 60% improvement in maternal health outcomes while preserving traditional knowledge systems.
