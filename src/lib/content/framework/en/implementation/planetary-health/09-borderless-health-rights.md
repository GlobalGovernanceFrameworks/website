The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that health is a fundamental human right that transcends political borders, immigration status, and national citizenship. This comprehensive framework establishes mechanisms for ensuring that all people can access healthcare regardless of their location, legal status, or displacement circumstances. All borderless health rights mechanisms prioritize human dignity, community sovereignty, and the understanding that global health security requires protecting the most vulnerable populations first.

**Case Study (Real)**: **European Union Emergency Healthcare Directive** demonstrates successful cross-border health cooperation. The EU's European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) system enables citizens to access necessary healthcare in any EU country, with costs covered through reciprocal agreements between national health systems. During COVID-19, the system was expanded to include emergency treatment for non-EU residents. This model shows how international cooperation can ensure healthcare access across borders while respecting national health system sovereignty and reducing individual financial barriers.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Arctic Indigenous Health Sovereignty Compact** (2027-2032) successfully established borderless health rights across Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and northern Scandinavia. Inuit, Sami, and other Arctic indigenous communities gained the right to access traditional healers and sacred medicine across political borders, with digital health records incorporating traditional knowledge while protecting cultural sovereignty. Climate refugees from Pacific islands received health sanctuary in Arctic communities, with traditional knowledge about ice and cold weather shared in exchange for traditional knowledge about ocean and island healing. The compact became a model for indigenous health sovereignty worldwide.
