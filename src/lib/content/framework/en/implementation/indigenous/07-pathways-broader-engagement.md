The pathways for broader engagement honor the principle that Indigenous sovereignty does not mean Indigenous isolation. While this framework is Indigenous-led and maintains Indigenous authority at every level, it creates multiple entry points for non-Indigenous people and organizations to support transformation while respecting Indigenous leadership and cultural protocols. These pathways emphasize relationship-building, mutual learning, and long-term commitment rather than extractive engagement or performative allyship.

Each pathway operates under the fundamental principle that allies support Indigenous leadership rather than directing or co-opting Indigenous initiatives. Engagement requires ongoing relationship, cultural education, and accountability to Indigenous communities rather than one-time actions or symbolic gestures. The framework provides clear guidance for ethical engagement while maintaining Indigenous authority over the terms and conditions of collaboration.

**Navigation Note**: These pathways for broader engagement provide multiple entry points for non-Indigenous people and organizations to support Indigenous-led transformation while maintaining Indigenous authority and cultural protocols. Continue to [Documentation and Risk Assessment](/framework/docs/implementation/indigenous#08-documentation-risk-assessment) to explore implementation challenges and success strategies, or access [Implementation Tools](/framework/tools/indigenous) for practical resources supporting ethical engagement and partnership development.

**Engagement Principles**: All broader engagement must operate under Indigenous leadership, respect cultural protocols, support Indigenous sovereignty, and commit to long-term relationship rather than extractive or transactional engagement. Allies support Indigenous initiatives rather than directing or co-opting Indigenous movements while taking responsibility for challenging colonialism within their own communities and institutions.
