# Traditional Knowledge Protection Guide for Indigenous Water Wisdom
## Safeguarding Ancestral Knowledge While Supporting Community-Controlled Innovation

### 🌊 Overview

This guide provides comprehensive frameworks for protecting Indigenous and traditional knowledge about water while supporting community-controlled sharing and application in contemporary water governance. Grounded in Indigenous rights, community sovereignty, and cultural protocols, it ensures traditional water wisdom strengthens rather than appropriates Indigenous communities while contributing to global water justice.

**Core Purpose**: Establish protection systems that honor the sacred nature of traditional knowledge, prevent appropriation and misuse, support community-controlled knowledge sharing, and ensure traditional wisdom guides rather than serves extractive water governance transformation.
