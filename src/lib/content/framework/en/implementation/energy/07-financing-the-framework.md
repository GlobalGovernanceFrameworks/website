Adequate, predictable, and equitably distributed financial resources are essential to implement the Climate & Energy Governance Framework. This section outlines the approach to financing climate action and energy transition, addressing both the sources of funding and how resources will be allocated to maximize impact while ensuring justice and effectiveness.

## <a id="sources-of-funding"></a>Sources of Funding

The framework establishes a diversified funding approach that mobilizes resources from multiple sources while ensuring appropriate burden-sharing based on capacity and responsibility.

### Public Finance

Public finance remains a cornerstone of climate funding, with emphasis on:

- **Nationally Determined Contributions**: Domestic budget allocations by all countries toward their climate commitments, proportional to their capabilities and adaptation needs.

- **Multilateral Climate Funds**: Enhanced capitalization of existing funds such as the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, and Least Developed Countries Fund, with streamlined access and increased grant components.

- **Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)**: Expanded climate financing through MDBs, including the World Bank Group, regional development banks, and new climate-focused development institutions, with reformed governance ensuring equitable representation.

- **Bilateral Climate Finance**: Direct country-to-country support for climate action, coordinated through the framework to maximize efficiency and minimize duplication.

### Reparative Contributions

Building on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the framework introduces:

- **Climate Finance Obligations**: Legally binding commitments from developed countries to provide climate finance to developing nations, scaled according to:
  - Historical emissions contribution (from 1850 onward)
  - Current per capita emissions
  - National economic capacity (GDP per capita)

- **Climate Capacity Index**: An equity-adjusted formula determining fair financial contributions based on a comprehensive assessment of historical responsibility, current emissions, economic capacity, and technological capability.

- **Minimum Contribution Levels**: Requirements for high-emitting developed nations to commit 0.5-1% of GDP to international climate finance, in addition to domestic climate spending.

- **Compliance Mechanisms**: Clear consequences for failing to meet climate finance obligations, potentially including trade measures, reputational impacts, and limits on participation in governance bodies.

### Private Finance Mobilization

Recognizing that public finance alone is insufficient, the framework catalyzes private investment through:

- **Blended Finance Instruments**: Strategic use of public funds to reduce risk and leverage private investment through guarantees, first-loss provisions, and concessional components.

- **Green Bonds and Climate Bonds**: Standardized frameworks for climate-aligned debt instruments, with verification systems and market development support.

- **Climate Investment Platforms**: Structured approaches to aggregating projects, matching them with investors, and reducing transaction costs.

- **Policy De-risking**: Coordinated policy reforms across jurisdictions to create stable, predictable investment environments for clean energy and climate solutions.

### Innovative Funding Sources

To expand available resources, the framework promotes innovative finance mechanisms:

- **Carbon Pricing Revenues**: Earmarking a portion of carbon tax or emissions trading revenues for climate finance, including international support from developed to developing countries.

- **Financial Transaction Tax**: Small levies on financial transactions (e.g., 0.1% on securities trades) dedicated to climate finance, focusing on international flows.

- **Fossil Fuel Subsidy Redirection**: Phased elimination of fossil fuel subsidies with a portion of savings allocated to clean energy access and just transition.

- **Climate Damages Tax**: Levies on fossil fuel extraction to fund climate loss and damage responses, scaled to carbon content and producer country development status.

- **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)**: Use of IMF Special Drawing Rights for climate finance, particularly for urgent adaptation needs and climate emergencies.

### Geopolitically Resilient Funding

The framework includes specific mechanisms to maintain financial flows despite geopolitical tensions:

- **Diversified Financial Channels**: Multiple, parallel funding pathways to prevent single-point blockages during political disputes
- **Politically Neutral Financing Vehicles**: Trust funds and financial intermediaries with governance structures acceptable across geopolitical divides
- **Protected Financial Corridors**: Designated climate finance channels insulated from broader economic sanctions or trade disputes
- **Non-State Finance Networks**: Mobilization of private and philanthropic capital that can flow despite governmental tensions

### Domestic Resource Mobilization

The framework emphasizes strengthening countries' abilities to generate domestic resources for climate action:

- **Tax System Strengthening**: Technical assistance to enhance revenue collection efficiency and broaden tax bases, particularly for environmental and carbon taxation.

- **Fossil Subsidy Reform**: Support for politically feasible subsidy reform pathways that protect vulnerable populations while freeing up fiscal resources.

- **Green Budgeting**: Implementation of climate budget tagging and green public financial management to prioritize climate-compatible expenditures.

- **Local Capital Market Development**: Technical support for developing domestic bond markets capable of supporting green bond issuance.

- **Public-Private Partnerships**: Frameworks for leveraging private capital while ensuring public interest protections and equitable risk-sharing.

## <a id="allocation-principles"></a>Allocation Principles

The framework establishes clear principles for how climate and energy finance should be allocated to achieve maximum impact while ensuring equity and accountability.

### Thematic Balance

The framework addresses historical imbalances in climate finance through:

- **Adaptation Floor**: Minimum of 50% of public climate finance directed to adaptation, addressing the current skew toward mitigation funding.

- **Loss and Damage Fund**: A dedicated funding stream for addressing irreversible climate impacts, distinct from adaptation financing, reaching at least $100 billion annually by 2030.

- **Just Transition Financing**: Specific allocations for supporting workers and communities affected by the phase-out of fossil fuels and carbon-intensive industries.

- **Enabling Environment Support**: Resources for policy development, institutional strengthening, and capacity building to create conditions for effective climate action.

### Geographic Prioritization

The framework directs resources based on need and vulnerability:

- **Vulnerability-Based Allocation**: Prioritization of funding to countries and regions most vulnerable to climate impacts, including Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries, and drought-prone regions of Africa.

- **Balanced Geographic Distribution**: Mechanisms to ensure all developing regions receive appropriate support, avoiding concentration in a few countries or regions.

- **Local Access**: Direct access modalities enabling subnational governments, community organizations, and local institutions to access climate finance without national intermediation where appropriate.

- **Regional Approaches**: Support for transboundary and regional initiatives addressing shared climate challenges such as river basin management, disaster risk reduction, and regional power integration.

### Effectiveness and Efficiency

To maximize impact of limited resources, the framework promotes:

- **Results-Based Finance**: Linking a portion of climate funding to verified outcomes while maintaining upfront support for countries with limited capacity.

- **Programmatic Approaches**: Moving beyond project-by-project funding to programmatic support for systemic transformation.

- **Harmonized Procedures**: Standardized application, reporting, and verification procedures across funding sources to reduce transaction costs.

- **Technology Cost Curves**: Allocation strategies that accelerate cost reductions for key technologies through strategic market creation and deployment support.

### Transparency and Accountability

The framework establishes robust tracking of climate finance through:

- **Standardized Accounting**: Common methodologies for tracking, reporting, and verifying climate finance flows, addressing current inconsistencies in what countries count as climate finance.

- **Independent Verification**: Third-party assessment of whether finance meets agreed definitions, reaches intended recipients, and delivers expected results.

- **Beneficiary Feedback**: Mechanisms for recipients of climate finance to provide input on effectiveness, accessibility, and impacts of funding.

- **Public Registry**: Comprehensive, user-friendly database of all climate finance commitments, disbursements, and results, accessible to all stakeholders.
