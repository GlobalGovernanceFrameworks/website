## <a id="pandemic-resilience"></a>Pandemic Resilience Module

**Objective**: Ensure *Hearts* system resilience during pandemics.

### Contactless Care Validation Protocols

The module adapts validation for health emergencies:

- **Virtual care logging** via video calls, verified by AI sentiment analysis
- **QR-code-based care attestations** for physical distancing, with pilot programs in 2027

### Viral Load-Adjusted *Hearts* Distribution

Allocation is adapted during health crises:

- **Prioritize *Hearts*** for healthcare workers and vulnerable groups during outbreaks, adjusted via DAO vote
- **Model**: 20% *Hearts* bonus for frontline workers, based on local infection rates

### Epidemic Love Ledger Weighting

Contribution valuation shifts during pandemics:

- **Increase care score multiplier** (e.g., 1.5x) for acts like vaccine distribution or mental health support
- **Implementation**: Pilot in 5 cities by 2028, $200K budget

## <a id="space-economy"></a>Space Economy Bridge

**Objective**: Extend *Hearts* to extraterrestrial economies.

### Lunar *Hearts* Conversion Standards

Space resource valuation includes:

- **Convert lunar resource contributions** (e.g., water extraction) to *Hearts*, with pilot programs with ESA/NASA by 2030
- **Rate**: 1 ton of lunar water = 1,000 *Hearts*

### Off-Planet Care Validation

Care economies extend beyond Earth:

- **Log astronaut care acts** (e.g., team support) via blockchain, with pilot implementation on the ISS by 2029
- **Recognition of space contribution** to Earth's commons

### Orbital Resource Credits
