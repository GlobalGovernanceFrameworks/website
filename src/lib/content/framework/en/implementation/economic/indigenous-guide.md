The Indigenous Economic Stewardship Guide empowers indigenous communities to lead and shape economic systems within the Nested Sovereignty Framework, ensuring alignment with traditional knowledge, cultural values, and the principles of sovereignty, interoperability, justice, and adaptability. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for indigenous communities to implement community currencies, commons governance, cooperatives, and advocacy campaigns, fostering economic resilience and self-determination. Co-designed with indigenous elders, youth, women, and non-binary individuals, it prioritizes accessibility, cultural integrity, and equitable participation, enabling indigenous communities to contribute to a just and sustainable global economy by 2035.

## <a id="core-principles"></a>Core Principles
The guide is grounded in indigenous-led principles:
1. **Sovereignty**: Indigenous communities control their economic systems, rooted in traditional governance and land stewardship.
2. **Cultural Integrity**: Economic initiatives honor indigenous knowledge, languages, and practices, ensuring alignment with community values.
3. **Equity**: 50% representation of indigenous women, non-binary individuals, and youth in leadership, prioritizing marginalized voices.
4. **Reciprocity**: Economic systems foster mutual benefit, balancing community needs with environmental and social responsibilities.
5. **Adaptability**: Initiatives evolve through community feedback and traditional ecological knowledge, ensuring resilience.

## <a id="indigenous-approaches-to-monetary-authority-relations"></a>Indigenous Approaches to Monetary Authority Relations

Indigenous communities face unique considerations when navigating relationships with central banks and monetary authorities. Historical sovereignty conflicts, colonial legacies, and distinct economic traditions may complicate these relationships, but also offer unique opportunities:

### Indigenous Monetary Sovereignty Framework

Indigenous communities can draw on their historical and cultural traditions when engaging with monetary authorities:

- **Historical Monetary Practices**: Document traditional exchange systems (wampum, potlatch, trade networks) as precedents for indigenous monetary sovereignty.

- **Treaty-Based Approaches**: Where applicable, reference existing treaties that may provide basis for economic self-determination, including monetary aspects.

- **Cultural Values Integration**: Emphasize how community currencies embody indigenous values (reciprocity, sustainability, community welfare) that align with central bank mandates for economic wellbeing.

- **Parallel Authority Structures**: Position indigenous governance bodies as rightful monetary authorities within traditional territories, seeking nation-to-nation dialogue rather than regulator-to-subject relationships.

### Practical Engagement Strategies

Indigenous communities can implement specific approaches when engaging monetary authorities:

1. **Cultural Education Component**:
   - Include educational materials on indigenous economic traditions when engaging central banks.
   - Demonstrate how community currencies represent continuation of historical indigenous exchange systems.
   - Position currency initiatives within broader indigenous economic revitalization.

2. **Rights-Based Dialogue**:
   - Frame discussions in terms of indigenous rights to economic self-determination.
   - Reference UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) provisions on economic sovereignty.
   - Approach engagement as nation-to-nation rather than as regulated entities.

3. **Collaborative Models**:
   - Propose joint research on indigenous economic resilience models.
   - Invite central bank representatives to observe traditional economic practices.
   - Develop case studies on how indigenous approaches to community currencies support broader economic stability.

4. **Strategic Alliance Building**:
   - Partner with indigenous communities in other regions who have successfully navigated central bank relations.
   - Build alliances with sympathetic departments within central banks (e.g., community development, financial inclusion).
   - Engage indigenous economists and financial experts to bridge traditional knowledge and monetary policy understanding.

Indigenous communities implementing the Tyendinaga Mohawk Currency in Canada and the Lakota Nation with MazaCoin demonstrate how indigenous monetary initiatives can navigate complex sovereignty questions while advancing economic self-determination. By grounding currency projects in cultural traditions and rights-based frameworks, indigenous communities can establish unique relationships with monetary authorities that respect their special legal and historical status.
