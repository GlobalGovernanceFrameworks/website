# Appendix B: Comprehensive Glossary

**In this appendix:**
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Glossary of Terms](#glossary-of-terms)

**Estimated Reading Time**: 8 minutes

This appendix provides a comprehensive glossary of key terms used in the *Global Governance Biodiversity Implementation Framework*. These definitions ensure consistent understanding across stakeholders, including indigenous communities, policymakers, youth, private sector actors, and global institutions. Terms are defined with precision and accessibility, supporting translation into multiple languages, including indigenous languages like Quechua by 2030, and adhering to inclusive language principles.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The glossary standardizes terminology to facilitate implementation, collaboration, and evaluation of the Biodiversity Framework. Each term is defined to reflect its role in achieving a regenerative biosphere by 2045, aligning with the framework’s principles of indigenous sovereignty, economic transformation, and cultural mobilization. Definitions are concise, culturally sensitive, and designed for adaptability across diverse governance contexts, as per the *Global Governance Framework Documentation Style Guide*.
