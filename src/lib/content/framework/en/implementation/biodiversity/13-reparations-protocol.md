The Global Governance Biodiversity Implementation Framework recognizes that effective biodiversity protection requires addressing historical injustices that created the current ecological crisis. This reparations protocol centers indigenous sovereignty and community control while acknowledging that colonialism, extractive capitalism, and systematic appropriation of traditional knowledge have directly caused biodiversity loss and cultural destruction. Reparations are not charity but justice—recognizing that indigenous peoples and local communities are Earth's most effective biodiversity stewards and deserve restoration of their rightful authority over traditional territories and knowledge systems. This framework prioritizes community-defined healing processes, traditional justice methods, and the understanding that ecological restoration and cultural revitalization are inseparable aspects of planetary healing.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Indigenous Land Back Movements** (2008-2015, ongoing) demonstrate the importance of community-controlled truth processes and land repatriation. The TRC documented residential school impacts while Indigenous communities led land back movements resulting in several territorial recoveries. However, criticism from Indigenous communities emphasized the need for more community control over truth processes and faster land repatriation implementation, informing this framework's emphasis on indigenous sovereignty throughout reparations.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Amazon Traditional Knowledge Repatriation Initiative** (2029-2032) successfully recovered traditional knowledge for 50 indigenous communities across Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. Using community-controlled legal advocacy and traditional justice processes, communities recovered medicinal plant knowledge, agricultural innovations, and ecological wisdom from university and corporate databases. The initiative returned $50 million in intellectual property value to communities while strengthening traditional knowledge transmission and cultural sovereignty, demonstrating effective community-controlled knowledge justice.
