## 13. Economic Foundations for Global Citizenship

### AUBI: Creating the Conditions for Global Citizenship

Global citizenship requires certain foundational conditions to flourish. Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) represents a transformative approach that can enable fuller participation in global citizenship by:

- **Providing Economic Security**: By ensuring basic needs are met, AUBI frees individuals to engage with broader concerns beyond immediate survival
- **Recognizing Diverse Contributions**: AUBI's value recognition component acknowledges non-market activities essential to global citizenship
- **Enabling Cross-Border Mobility**: With baseline economic security, individuals can more easily engage in transnational experiences
- **Supporting Transition Periods**: AUBI provides stability during periods of adaptation to global changes

#### The Three Pillars of AUBI Supporting Global Citizenship

1. **Universality**: Creates a foundation of inclusion that mirrors global citizenship's expansive identity
2. **Adaptability**: Recognizes contextual differences while maintaining common principles, similar to how global citizenship values manifest differently across cultures
3. **Societal Value Recognition**: Acknowledges contributions to collective wellbeing, regardless of whether they generate market value

#### Case Studies: AUBI in Practice

**Maricá, Brazil: Mumbuca Currency System**
This coastal city implemented a basic income program using a local digital currency called Mumbuca. Recipients receive 130 Mumbucas monthly (approximately $25 USD), which can be spent at local businesses. The program has increased:
- Community participation in environmental protection initiatives
- Cross-cultural knowledge sharing through local educational programs
- Small business formation focused on sustainable tourism
- Civic engagement in municipal decision-making

**Alaska Permanent Fund: Resource Dividend Model**
Since 1982, Alaska has distributed annual dividends to all residents from its sovereign wealth fund based on oil revenues. Research shows this has:
- Reduced poverty without decreasing labor participation
- Increased community volunteerism and cultural activities
- Enabled greater participation in climate resilience planning
- Supported indigenous cultural practices and language preservation

**Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED)**
This California-based pilot provided $500 monthly to selected residents for 24 months. Results demonstrated:
- Increased full-time employment among recipients
- Improved mental health and decreased stress
- Greater parental involvement in children's education
- Higher rates of community leadership and civic involvement

### Theoretical Foundations
- **Expanding Moral Circle**: The historical pattern of extending moral consideration to previously excluded groups
- **Biocentric and Ecocentric Ethics**: Philosophical frameworks that locate intrinsic value in all living beings or entire ecosystems
- **Sentientism**: The view that moral consideration should extend to all beings capable of experiencing suffering
- **Intergenerational Ethics**: Consideration of rights and interests of future generations
- **Non-Anthropocentric Perspectives**: Indigenous and Eastern philosophical traditions that have long recognized the moral standing of non-human entities

As global citizens progress in their journey, many begin to expand their circle of consideration beyond humans:

- **Level 3 (Empathy)**: Developing empathy for non-human beings and systems affected by human actions
- **Level 4 (Participation)**: Including consideration of non-human impacts in decision-making and lifestyle choices
- **Level 5 (Leadership)**: Creating systems and approaches that integrate human and non-human wellbeing


### Spectrum of Approaches
Different global citizens may adopt varying positions along this spectrum:

1. **Human-Centered with Consideration**: Prioritizing human interests while acknowledging responsibilities toward other beings
2. **Guardian/Stewardship Model**: Humans as representatives and protectors of non-human interests
3. **Rights-Based Recognition**: Formal acknowledgment of legal rights for specific non-human entities
4. **Full Moral Community**: Recognition of diverse beings as fellow members of an extended moral community

### Categories of Non-Human Inclusion

#### Animals

# Appendix A: Conflict Navigation Matrix

When practicing global citizenship, you'll inevitably encounter conflicts across different scales and contexts. This matrix provides structured approaches to navigate these challenges constructively.

## Step-by-Step Mediation Protocol

**1. Preparation Phase**
- Create a safe, neutral environment for dialogue
- Establish ground rules for respectful communication
- Clarify that the goal is understanding, not necessarily agreement
- Ensure all participants have equal voice opportunities

**2. Perspective Sharing**
- Each party shares their experience without interruption
- Focus on "I" statements rather than accusations
- Document key concerns and underlying needs
- Validate emotional experiences without judgment

**3. Understanding Development**
- Identify shared values beneath differing positions
- Map interconnections between different perspectives
- Acknowledge historical context influencing current tensions
- Separate people from problems to reduce defensiveness

**4. Solution Exploration**
- Generate multiple options without immediate evaluation
- Consider solutions at different scales (individual to systemic)
- Evaluate potential approaches against shared values
- Develop graduated implementation plans

**5. Agreement & Follow-Through**
- Create specific, measurable commitments
- Establish accountability mechanisms
- Schedule regular review points
- Document lessons learned for future conflicts

## Conflict Navigation Flowchart

When facing competing rights or values, this decision flow can help determine ethical paths forward:

![Conflict Navigation Flowchart](frameworks/7-conflict-navigation-flowchart.svg)

The flowchart should include these key decision points:
1. Is there imminent harm requiring immediate intervention?
2. Are fundamental rights being violated?
3. Can both positions be accommodated simultaneously?
4. Are there underlying needs being expressed through positions?
5. Would a temporary solution create space for deeper resolution?
6. Is systemic change needed for sustainable resolution?

## Case Studies in Transformative Conflict Resolution

**Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)**
Following apartheid, South Africa established a commission focused on restorative rather than retributive justice. Key elements included:
- Public truth-telling by both perpetrators and victims
- Amnesty conditional on full disclosure of political crimes
- Reparations for victims and communities
- Institutional reforms to prevent recurrence
- Documentation for historical record and education

**Lesson for Global Citizens**: Truth-telling creates the foundation for healing, but must be accompanied by structural changes to address root causes.

**Aceh Peace Process (Indonesia)**
After decades of conflict between the Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian government, a sustainable peace was established through:
- International facilitation following the 2004 tsunami
- Recognition of Acehnese cultural identity within Indonesia
- Resource-sharing agreements for natural resources
- Monitoring mechanisms with international participation
- Gradual demilitarization with dignity preserved

**Lesson for Global Citizens**: Natural disasters can create openings for peace when approached with respect for identity and fair resource distribution.

**Community Dialogue Circles (Rwanda)**
Rwanda's post-genocide reconciliation included the adaptation of traditional community justice (gacaca) through:
- Community-selected judges from respected elders
- Public proceedings accessible to all community members
- Focus on truth, confession, and community service
- Reintegration rituals for both perpetrators and survivors
- Community healing simultaneously with individual accountability

**Lesson for Global Citizens**: Indigenous conflict resolution practices offer powerful alternatives to Western judicial models when adapted thoughtfully.

## Navigating Complex Value Tensions

Global citizens often face situations where deeply held values appear to conflict. This matrix helps navigate these tensions:

| Tension | Balanced Approach | Example |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Individual rights vs. Community harmony | Seek solutions that protect core rights while respecting relationship contexts | The right to expression exercised with cultural sensitivity |
| Traditional values vs. Universal rights | Honor cultural contexts while establishing baseline protections | Community-led evolution of practices affecting women's autonomy |
| Truth-telling vs. Peace preservation | Create safe spaces for truth while focusing on future relationships | Dialogue formats like "speaking bitterly, ending sweetly" used in Indonesia |
| Justice vs. Reconciliation | Develop processes that address harm while creating pathways for reintegration | Community service combined with victim compensation |
| Short-term relief vs. Long-term transformation | Meet immediate needs while building capacity for systemic change | Economic assistance paired with educational opportunities |

## Personal Practices for Conflict Transformation

As a global citizen, develop these capacities for navigating conflict:

1. **Self-Awareness**: Recognize your own triggers, biases, and cultural assumptions
2. **Deep Listening**: Hear both spoken words and underlying needs
3. **Curiosity Cultivation**: Approach differences with genuine interest rather than judgment
4. **Emotional Regulation**: Manage intense emotions without suppressing or expressing them harmfully
5. **Systems Thinking**: Identify patterns, relationships, and root causes beyond immediate tensions
