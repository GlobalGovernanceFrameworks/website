The expected outcomes of this framework represent more than policy goals—they embody the vision of a regenerative future where Indigenous sovereignty, ecological health, and planetary wellbeing create the foundation for all human and non-human thriving. These outcomes emerge from thousands of years of Indigenous governance success while addressing contemporary challenges of climate breakdown, technological transformation, and global coordination.

Each outcome reflects Traditional Ecological Knowledge applied at planetary scale, demonstrating how Indigenous governance systems create conditions for ecological restoration, cultural flourishing, and intergenerational justice. They represent not utopian dreams but practical achievements already demonstrated in Indigenous territories worldwide, now scaled through bioregional coordination and Indigenous solidarity networks.
