**Case Study (Real)**: **Indigenous Fire Management Crisis Response in Australia** demonstrates successful traditional knowledge crisis response integration. Aboriginal communities' traditional fire management knowledge guided emergency response during 2019-2020 bushfire crisis, reducing fire intensity and protecting both ecosystems and communities through traditional burning practices and community coordination that proved more effective than external emergency management approaches.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Amazon Biodiversity Crisis Response Network** (2030-2031) successfully coordinated emergency response across 100 indigenous territories when illegal mining operations threatened 500,000 hectares of rainforest. Using traditional early warning systems enhanced with community-controlled technology, indigenous communities activated 72-hour SWAT Team deployment that halted mining operations while traditional restoration techniques recovered 80% of damaged areas within 18 months, demonstrating effective traditional knowledge crisis response guided by community sovereignty.
