**Estimated Implementation Time**: 3-6 months per community consultation process
**Template Usage**: Adapt sections to specific community contexts, legal systems, and cultural protocols

The FPIC 2.0 Protocols Template represents a revolutionary evolution of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent that honors indigenous sovereignty while leveraging blockchain technology for transparent, immutable consent documentation. This enhanced framework moves beyond minimal consultation to establish genuine community control, traditional governance recognition, and perpetual consent management that can be modified or withdrawn at any time. FPIC 2.0 recognizes that true consent requires not just information sharing, but power sharing, economic justice, and the understanding that indigenous communities are sovereign decision-makers rather than stakeholders to be consulted.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Maori Whakapapa Consent Protocols in New Zealand** demonstrate successful traditional governance integration with modern consent processes. Maori communities developed consultation protocols based on whakapapa (genealogical connections) and traditional decision-making that require relationship building, cultural competency demonstration, and ongoing consent verification. These protocols have increased Maori community control over development projects while strengthening traditional governance and cultural practice transmission.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Amazon Indigenous Blockchain Consent Network** (2028-2030) successfully implemented FPIC 2.0 across 50 communities in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. Using traditional confederation governance enhanced with community-controlled blockchain technology, indigenous communities documented consent decisions while maintaining complete cultural protocol compliance and traditional knowledge protection. The network prevented 15 unauthorized biopiracy attempts while generating $2 million in traditional knowledge licensing revenue for community-controlled development.

**Legal Integration Note**: These FPIC 2.0 protocols are designed to integrate with existing legal frameworks while transforming them toward indigenous rights recognition. Communities should work with indigenous rights lawyers to ensure protocols comply with national laws while strengthening traditional governance and cultural sovereignty.

**Cross-Reference Note**: These FPIC 2.0 Protocols integrate with [Traditional Knowledge Protection](/frameworks/docs/implementation/biodiversity#traditional-knowledge-protection-repatriation) for intellectual property sovereignty, [Indigenous-Led Governance](/frameworks/docs/implementation/biodiversity#03-core-pillars-indigenous) for traditional authority recognition, [Regional Adaptation Guidelines](/frameworks/docs/implementation/biodiversity#regional-adaptation-guidelines) for cultural context, and [Implementation Tools](/frameworks/docs/implementation/biodiversity#12-implementation-tools) for practical deployment resources including blockchain setup guides and cultural competency training materials.
