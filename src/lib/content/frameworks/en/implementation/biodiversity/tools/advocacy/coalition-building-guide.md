This guide provides a structured framework for building a 20-nation coalition to secure advisory status with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and foster multilateral cooperation for biodiversity restoration. Aligned with the Global Governance Biodiversity Implementation Framework’s Global Cooperation and Implementation Pillars, it supports the $10B Global Biodiversity Fund, Public Trust Dashboard, and FPIC 2.0 protocols to ensure transparency and indigenous leadership. The guide includes tools, metrics, and examples to guide stakeholders in achieving measurable ecological and diplomatic outcomes.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The **Coalition Building Strategy Guide** is a resource designed to empower indigenous councils, Regional Biodiversity Hubs, diplomats, and international organizations to form a 20-nation coalition that advances biodiversity restoration through CBD advisory status and multilateral cooperation. It addresses the framework’s vision of a regenerative biosphere by 2045 by uniting diverse nations, prioritizing Global South and indigenous voices, and mobilizing resources for biodiversity hotspots. Key objectives include:

- **Coalition Formation**: Establish a 20-nation coalition with CBD advisory status by 2030.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Ensure 50% of coalition leadership includes indigenous or Global South representatives via FPIC 2.0 protocols.
- **Resource Mobilization**: Secure $1B annually through coalition-driven agreements by 2035.
- **Biodiversity Impact**: Achieve 20% ecosystem recovery in coalition-linked hotspots by 2035.

**Purpose**: To provide actionable tools for building a global coalition that drives biodiversity restoration through equitable, transparent, and indigenous-led cooperation.

**Primary Users**: Indigenous councils, diplomats, Regional Biodiversity Hubs, policymakers, international organizations.

**Integration**: Complements the [Diplomatic Engagement Playbook](/frameworks/tools/biodiversity/diplomatic-engagement-playbook-en.pdf), [Funding Navigator for Biodiversity Projects](/frameworks/tools/biodiversity/funding-navigator-biodiversity-projects-en.pdf), and [Public Trust Dashboard & Evaluation Template](/frameworks/tools/biodiversity/public-trust-dashboard-evaluation-en.pdf).

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study (Fictive)

**Case Study (Fictive)**: 20-Nation Biodiversity Coalition

In 2032, a 20-nation coalition, led by Brazil, Indonesia, and Kenya, with 50% indigenous representation, secured CBD advisory status. The coalition, formed through BCT Shadow Council protocols, included 10 Global South nations and mobilized $300M for restoration in the Amazon, Congo Basin, and Coral Triangle. Blockchain-secured commitments on the Public Trust Dashboard ensured 100% transparency. A #BioDebt-integrated summit engaged 10,000 stakeholders, influencing 20% of CBD policies. Outcomes included a 15% forest recovery and $150M reinvested into UBES systems. This example demonstrates the power of indigenous-led coalitions in driving global biodiversity restoration.

## <a id="risk-mitigation"></a>Risk Mitigation

Risks are managed to protect community interests and ensure coalition success.

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Nation dropout | Medium | High | Strategic incentives (e.g., BIBs, swaps); BCT Shadow Council mediation. |
| Community exclusion | Low | High | 50% indigenous leadership; FPIC 2.0 protocols; Justice Translators. |
| Funding delays | Medium | Medium | Diversified funding commitments; 5% contingency fund. |
| Policy misalignment | Medium | High | International Coordination Framework; annual summits. |

**Contingency Measures**:
- **Emergency Fund**: 5% of funds ($50,000–$250,000) reserved for crises (e.g., funding gaps, diplomatic disputes).
- **Community Recall**: Indigenous veto power to pause coalition activities if cultural or ecological harm occurs.
- **Rapid Response**: 72-hour deployment of mediators for disputes or SWAT Teams for ecological crises.
