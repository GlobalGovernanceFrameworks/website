### For LinkedIn / Facebook:

The climate crisis isn't just an environmental issue; it's a failure of international law. We lack the tools to hold the biggest polluters accountable for large-scale environmental destruction.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" changes that by establishing "Ecocide" as a prosecutable international crime, creating a powerful legal deterrent to protect our shared global commons. This is a critical step towards real climate justice.

### For Twitter / X:

```
It's time to make destroying our planet a crime.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" calls for establishing "Ecocide" as an international crime. This gives us the legal teeth to protect our ecosystems and hold polluters accountable.

### For LinkedIn / Facebook:

The debate over climate action often misses the most important point: the cost of inaction is catastrophic. We are facing trillions in damages.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" presents a fiscally responsible path forward. By implementing tools like a global carbon tax, we can create sustainable, independent funding for the solutions that ensure our collective survival. This isn't just a moral imperative; it's a sound investment in a stable future.

See the framework: https://globalgovernanceframework.org

**Hashtags:** #GlobalEconomy #CarbonTax #ClimateFinance #ESG #Investment

### For Twitter / X:

```
The cost of doing nothing about the climate crisis? $54 Trillion.

The cost of smart reform? A fraction of that.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" offers a fiscally responsible plan to fund our survival.

### For LinkedIn / Facebook:

Many people feel that global decisions are made without their input. This democratic deficit fuels distrust and hinders collective action.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" tackles this head-on. The proposed "Global Citizens' Initiative" empowers as few as 10 million people from across the world to bring binding referendums to the global stage. This is a powerful step towards a more legitimate, participatory, and democratic world.

**Hashtags:** #Democracy #CitizenEngagement #GlobalCitizenship #PeoplePower #Governance

### For Twitter / X:

```
What if 10 million citizens could demand a global vote on climate?

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" proposes a Global Citizens' Initiative to make that a reality, giving people a real voice on the world stage.

This is what real democracy looks like: https://globalgovernanceframework.org
