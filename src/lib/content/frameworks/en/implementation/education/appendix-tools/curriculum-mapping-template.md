# Curriculum Mapping Template

**Purpose**: Aligns the framework’s competencies (e.g., systems thinking, regenerative design) with national or local curricula, facilitating legacy system integration ([Section 4.1 – Implementation Strategies](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)). This template ensures seamless adoption while prioritizing equity and cultural relevance.

**Usage**:

* **Who**: Educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers.
* **How**: Map framework competencies to existing standards, identify gaps, and propose integration strategies (e.g., electives, hybrid assessments).
* **When**: During pilot planning ([Section 4.1 – Implementation Strategies](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) or scaling ([Section 4.1 – Implementation Strategies](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
* **Formats**: Editable Word doc, PDF, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille).

**Equity Safeguards**:

* Include multilingual modules to support linguistic diversity.
* Adapt assessments for neurodiverse and non-literate learners (e.g., oral portfolios).
* Prioritize marginalized group representation in content (e.g., Indigenous knowledge, caste inclusion).
* Free distribution for low-income and crisis-affected regions.

| Systems Thinking ([Section 3.2 – Structural Components](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#03-structural-components))    | e.g., Science: Analyze ecosystems        | Add module on mapping local water systems | Multilingual guides, sensory-friendly materials    | \$5K for training, 10 educator hours     |
| Regenerative Design ([Section 3.3 – Structural Components](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#03-structural-components)) | e.g., Geography: Sustainable development | Elective on permaculture projects         | Include Indigenous practices, refugee perspectives | \$10K for materials, community workshops |
| Global Citizenship ([Section 3.4 – Structural Components](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#03-structural-components))  | e.g., Civics: Democratic processes       | Youth council policy projects             | LGBTQ+ and caste inclusion modules                 | \$8K for digital platforms, mentors      |

**Instructions**:

1. **Identify Competencies**: List framework competencies from [Section 3 – Structural Components](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#03-structural-components) (e.g., systems thinking, global citizenship).
2. **Map to Standards**: Align with national or local curriculum standards, noting overlaps or gaps.
3. **Propose Strategies**: Suggest integration methods (e.g., electives, hybrid assessments) per [Section 4.1 – Implementation Strategies](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies).
4. **Address Equity**: Ensure inclusion of marginalized groups (e.g., neurodiverse, refugees) per [Section 2.2.5 – Equity Principle](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#02-vision-principles).
5. **Estimate Resources**: Budget for training, materials, or tech, aligned with [Section 4.7 – Resource Mobilization](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies).
6. **Validate**: Engage community boards for cultural relevance ([Section 5.5 – Community-Led M\&E](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#55-community-led-mne)).

**Example Use**: In Thailand, educators used this template to integrate systems thinking into national science standards, improving critical thinking by 25% for 1,000 learners ([Section 8.4 – Spiral Dynamics Pilot in Southeast Asia](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#84-spiral-dynamics-pilot-in-southeast-asia)).
