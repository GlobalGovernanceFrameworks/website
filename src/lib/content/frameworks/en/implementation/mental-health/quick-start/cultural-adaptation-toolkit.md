# Cultural Adaptation Toolkit
## Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health

> *"One framework, infinite expressions - honoring cultural wisdom while maintaining universal human rights."*

## Overview

The Cultural Adaptation Toolkit enables communities to implement the Living Mandala framework while honoring their unique cultural values, traditional healing practices, and community governance approaches. Rather than imposing standardized solutions, this toolkit facilitates community-controlled adaptation that strengthens rather than undermines cultural identity.

**Core Principle**: Every culture possesses wisdom about mental health and healing that must be honored and integrated rather than replaced or appropriated.

### **Local Implementation Note** ⚠️
While grounded in research and cross-cultural best practices, cultural adaptation should involve consultation with community elders, traditional healers, and cultural authorities familiar with specific protocols and knowledge systems. Each community's adaptation will be unique and should honor local wisdom above external frameworks.

**Remember: The goal is not to make your culture fit the framework, but to make the framework serve your culture's wisdom about mental health and healing. Your community's knowledge is the authority - this toolkit simply provides structure for honoring that wisdom while connecting with broader transformation movements.**

**Cultural sovereignty in mental health means your community's way of understanding and addressing mental health is valid, valuable, and deserves support and resources. Start with your wisdom, adapt what serves, and create what doesn't yet exist.**
