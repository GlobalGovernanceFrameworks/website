# Hybrid Funding Agreement Template

## Introduction

Sustainable peacebuilding in low-resource contexts often requires a thoughtful blend of external support and local resources. This Hybrid Funding Agreement Template provides a framework for structuring partnerships between communities and external funders that promotes local ownership, transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and a gradual transition to self-reliance. The template is designed to be adaptable to diverse contexts while maintaining core principles of dignified partnership and sustainability.

### Purpose of This Template

This Hybrid Funding Agreement Template helps:
- Create clear, balanced relationships between communities and external funders
- Structure funding arrangements that supplement rather than replace local resources
- Establish transparent processes for resource management and decision-making
- Design clear pathways toward greater local resource mobilization
- Document commitments and responsibilities from all parties
- Prevent dependency while maximizing resource effectiveness

### How to Use This Template

This template includes:
1. A standard agreement format adaptable to different contexts
2. A simplified visual version for low-literacy settings
3. Optional clauses for specific situations
4. Implementation guidance and customization notes
5. Sample language for common funding arrangements

The agreement should be developed collaboratively between the community and external partners, with each section discussed thoroughly to ensure mutual understanding and consent. While maintaining legal validity, the emphasis should be on clear communication and relationship building rather than complex legal terminology.

## PART 5: SAMPLE LANGUAGE AND EXAMPLES

### Example: Matching Fund Arrangement

**Current Situation**:
A community in northern Uganda has formed a reconciliation committee to address tensions between returned abductees and community members. The committee can mobilize community meeting spaces, volunteer mediators, and cultural reconciliation ceremonies, but needs resources for training, documentation, and support for particularly vulnerable participants.

**Hybrid Approach**:
An international NGO proposes a 2:1 matching fund where they will contribute $2 for every $1 equivalent of community resources mobilized, up to a maximum of $10,000. The agreement includes:

**Community Contributions**:
- Meeting venue valued at $25 per meeting
- Volunteer time valued at $5 per hour
- Local food contributions for dialogues valued at actual market cost
- Traditional reconciliation rituals valued at $100 per ceremony

**External Partner Contributions**:
- Cash match at 2:1 ratio for verified community contributions
- Training in trauma-informed reconciliation approaches
- Documentation support for agreements reached
- Connections to regional reconciliation networks

**Progressive Transition**:
- Year 1: 2:1 matching ratio (community: 33%, external: 67%)
- Year 2: 1:1 matching ratio (community: 50%, external: 50%)
- Year 3: 1:2 matching ratio (community: 67%, external: 33%)
- Beyond: Community-led resource mobilization with technical support

### Example: Resource-Based Peace Fund

**Current Situation**:
A community in a mining region experiences tensions over benefit sharing from local mineral extraction. A company has agreed to support community peace initiatives through a percentage allocation from mining revenues.

**Hybrid Approach**:
A resource-based peace fund combining company contributions with community resources, with operations governed by a joint committee. The agreement includes:

**Resource Allocation**:
- 1% of monthly mineral extraction revenue allocated to peace fund
- Community contributes meeting facilities and peace committee time
- Local government provides administrative support
- Civil society provides technical guidance and monitoring

**Fund Governance**:
- Joint committee with equal company and community representation
- Transparent decision-making with community consultation
- Independent annual audit and public reporting
- Capacity building component for financial management

**Sustainability Mechanism**:
- Investment of 20% of annual fund in community-owned enterprise
- Enterprise profits return to peace fund to reduce company percentage
- Gradual transition to community management over 5 years
- Diversification of funding sources beginning in year 3

### Example: Revolving Peace Fund

**Current Situation**:
A post-conflict community needs to rebuild markets and trade relationships between previously divided ethnic groups. Trust is limited, but economic cooperation could support reconciliation.

**Hybrid Approach**:
A revolving fund providing small grants/loans for joint business initiatives across conflict lines, with returned funds supporting future peace-positive enterprises.

**Fund Structure**:
- Initial capitalization: $20,000 from donor, $5,000 from community contributions
- Zero-interest loans for cross-community business partnerships
- 10% of business profits contributed to community peace activities
- Loan repayments return to fund for next round of initiatives
- Progressive community management of fund operations

**Governance Arrangement**:
- Joint committee with equal representation from all community groups
- Transparent selection criteria emphasizing peace impact
- Business mentorship from local and external sources
- Community-based verification of peace outcomes

**Transition Plan**:
- Year 1-2: External partner leads fund management with community shadowing
- Year 3: Joint management with capacity transfer
- Year 4-5: Community-led management with external advisory
- Beyond: Fully community-owned revolving peace fund

- Local government officials who understand both formal and informal systems

## Conclusion

Hybrid funding agreements represent a bridge between external support and community self-reliance.

The process of developing such agreements is itself an opportunity for building mutual understanding, trust, and clear communication channels that will support successful implementation.

This template provides a starting point that should be adapted to each unique context. What matters most is not the specific form but the quality of partnership it creates—one characterized by mutual respect, clarity, and commitment to sustainable peace.
