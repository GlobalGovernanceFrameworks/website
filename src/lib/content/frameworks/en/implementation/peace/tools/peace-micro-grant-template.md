# Peace Micro-Grant Template

## Introduction

Small-scale peace initiatives often struggle to access funding due to complex application processes, extensive documentation requirements, and reporting expectations designed for larger organizations. This Peace Micro-Grant Template provides simplified tools for community-based peace initiatives to request, manage, and report on small grants (typically under $5,000) while maintaining appropriate accountability.

The template is designed to be:
- **Accessible** for users with limited literacy or grant-writing experience
- **Adaptable** for both digital and paper-based implementation
- **Visual** with pictorial options for key concepts
- **Practical** focusing on essential information without excessive requirements
- **Transparent** supporting community verification and oversight

## How to Use This Template

This resource includes four core components:
1. **Application Form**: For community groups to request micro-grant support
2. **Decision Guide**: For fund committees to evaluate applications consistently
3. **Agreement Format**: For documenting approved grant terms
4. **Reporting Template**: For simple, meaningful documentation of results

Each component includes:
- A standard text version for contexts with higher literacy
- A simplified visual version for low-literacy settings
- Implementation guidance notes for facilitators
- Customization options for different contexts

## PART 5: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Adapting the Templates

**Literacy Considerations**
- For higher-literacy contexts: Use the standard text version
- For mixed-literacy contexts: Use both versions side-by-side
- For low-literacy contexts: Use the visual version with facilitator support
- Consider audio recording options for oral cultures

**Cultural Adaptations**
- Replace visual symbols with locally meaningful equivalents
- Adapt verification mechanisms to align with community practices
- Modify terminology to reflect local peace concepts
- Incorporate traditional decision-making processes as appropriate

**Resource Constraints**
- Simplify the templates further if paper or printing is limited
- Consider using durable materials for reusable templates
- Develop community wall-charts for public tracking of grants
- Create pictorial flashcards for group application development

**Technology Integration**
- For areas with mobile access: Create SMS-based reporting formats
- For areas with smartphones: Develop simple app-based versions
- For areas with intermittent connectivity: Establish offline-compatible digital formats
- For areas with no connectivity: Maintain paper-based systems with clear physical filing

### Effective Facilitation

**Application Support**
- Conduct community information sessions before opening applications
- Provide neutral facilitators to assist multiple groups
- Create example applications as learning tools
- Use peer support between previous and new grantees

**Decision Making**
- Ensure diverse representation on decision committees
- Establish clear conflict of interest protocols
- Document decision rationales clearly
- Provide constructive feedback to unsuccessful applicants

**Agreement Process**
- Read agreements aloud for full understanding
- Use community witnesses for validation
- Create simple visual reminders of key commitments
- Establish accessible communication channels for questions

**Reporting Assistance**
- Offer drop-in help sessions for report completion
- Create peer learning opportunities between grantees
- Develop story collection techniques for impact documentation
- Use community verification to complement formal reporting

### Success Factors

**Key principles that maximize micro-grant effectiveness:**

1. **Prioritize Local Ownership**
   - Community members must lead identification of peace needs
   - Grant processes should strengthen, not replace, local initiative
   - External support should be catalytic rather than directive

2. **Balance Flexibility and Accountability**
   - Adapt requirements to match community capacities
   - Focus verification on meaningful outcomes, not procedural compliance
   - Allow for course-correction and learning during implementation

3. **Build in Learning Systems**
   - Create simple reflection opportunities throughout the process
   - Document and share innovations and solutions
   - Connect grantees for peer learning and support

4. **Maintain Transparency**
   - Ensure decision criteria are publicly known
   - Create appropriate community oversight mechanisms
   - Share outcomes and results widely

5. **Support Sustainability**
   - Link micro-grants to longer-term peace strategies
   - Gradually build community capacity for self-funding
   - Connect successful initiatives to other resources and networks

## Conclusion

This Peace Micro-Grant Template provides a simplified yet comprehensive system for supporting small-scale peacebuilding initiatives in low-resource contexts. By reducing administrative burdens while maintaining appropriate accountability, the template helps ensure that resources reach community-led peace efforts effectively.

The template can be further adapted to specific contexts, cultural practices, and operational realities. What matters most is that the process remains accessible, transparent, and supportive of genuine local peacebuilding initiatives.
