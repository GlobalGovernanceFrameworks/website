### Conflict Analysis Framework

The *Conflict Analysis Framework* is a structured tool within the *Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework* designed to help stakeholders systematically assess conflict dynamics, identify root causes, map stakeholders, and design context-specific peacebuilding interventions. Aligned with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and UNDP peacebuilding principles, this tool supports policymakers, mediators, community leaders, and civil society in fostering sustainable peace by addressing structural, cultural, and psychosocial factors (see [Core Peace & Conflict Resolution Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#core-principles)).

#### 1. Purpose
The framework enables users to:
- Identify conflict drivers, including resource inequities, governance failures, and cultural divides.
- Map stakeholders and their roles, ensuring inclusive engagement of women, youth, and marginalized groups.
- Analyze value systems and trauma impacts to design culturally resonant and trauma-informed interventions.
- Inform strategies for preventive diplomacy, restorative justice, and digital peacebuilding (see [Transitional Justice & Reconciliation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#transitional-justice), [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure)).

#### 2. Components
The framework consists of four core components, each supported by templates and guidance:
- **Conflict Drivers Assessment**: Evaluate structural, social, and environmental factors fueling conflict.
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify actors, their interests, and influence, prioritizing inclusivity.
- **Value System Analysis**: Use developmental frameworks (e.g., Spiral Dynamics) to understand cultural and worldview divides.
- **Psychosocial Impact Analysis**: Assess trauma and mental health needs to ensure trauma-informed interventions.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Process
Follow these steps to conduct a conflict analysis, adaptable for digital or non-digital settings:

1. **Define the Conflict Context**:
   - **Objective**: Establish the scope, geography, and timeline of the conflict.
   - **Actions**:
     - Gather data on conflict history, key events, and current status (e.g., active, post-conflict).
     - Use *Participatory Sensing Networks* for community input or interviews for non-digital settings (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure)).
   - **Output**: A conflict summary (1–2 pages or oral report for low-literacy groups).

2. **Assess Conflict Drivers**:
   - **Objective**: Identify root causes and triggers, including structural, social, and environmental factors.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Conflict Tree Template* to map causes (roots), core issues (trunk), and effects (branches).
     - Analyze resource inequities (e.g., land, water), governance failures, and cultural tensions.
     - Integrate *AI-Driven Conflict Prediction* for real-time data in high-tech settings or community workshops for low-tech contexts (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).
   - **Output**: Completed *Conflict Tree Template* visualizing drivers.

3. **Map Stakeholders**:
   - **Objective**: Identify actors, their roles, interests, and power dynamics.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Stakeholder Mapping Template* to categorize actors (e.g., government, civil society, women, youth).
     - Assess influence and alliances, ensuring marginalized groups are included.
     - Conduct *Multi-Track Dialogue Protocols* to gather stakeholder perspectives or focus groups in non-digital settings (see [Local Conflict Resolution Implementation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#local-implementation)).
   - **Output**: Stakeholder map with annotated roles and relationships.

4. **Analyze Value Systems**:
   - **Objective**: Understand cultural and worldview divides to design resonant interventions.
   - **Actions**:
     - Apply the *Value System Mapping Template* to identify developmental stages (e.g., traditional, modern, pluralistic) using frameworks like Spiral Dynamics (see [Developmental Value Systems & Peace](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#developmental-value-systems)).
     - Engage local leaders to translate value systems into dialogue strategies.
     - Use storytelling workshops for low-literacy communities to surface cultural norms.
   - **Output**: Value system map with intervention recommendations.

5. **Evaluate Psychosocial Impacts**:
   - **Objective**: Assess trauma and mental health needs to ensure trauma-informed peacebuilding.
   - **Actions**:
     - Conduct *Psychological Impact Assessments* to identify collective and intergenerational trauma, using *Community Healing Protocol* (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health)).
     - Engage community health workers or facilitators trained in *Nonviolent Communication (NVC)* to gather data sensitively.
     - Use *Psychosocial Metrics* to measure resilience, integrated with peace indicators (see [Measuring Peace Governance Success](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#measuring-success)).
   - **Output**: Psychosocial impact report with trauma-informed recommendations.

6. **Synthesize Findings and Recommend Interventions**:
   - **Objective**: Develop actionable peacebuilding strategies based on analysis.
   - **Actions**:
     - Combine outputs into a *Conflict Analysis Report* summarizing drivers, stakeholders, value systems, and psychosocial needs.
     - Recommend interventions (e.g., *Local Peace Committees*, *Community Truth-Telling Forums*, *Digital Safe Spaces*) tailored to context.
     - Use *Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit* to guide implementation (see [Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#trauma-informed-toolkit)).
   - **Output**: Comprehensive report or oral presentation for community settings.

#### 4. Implementation Modes
The framework is adaptable to diverse contexts:
- **Digital Implementation**:
  - Use *AI-Driven Conflict Prediction* and *Social Media Monitoring* for real-time data analysis in high-tech democracies (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure)).
  - Deploy *Blockchain-Based Truth Logs* to securely store stakeholder inputs in low-trust settings.
  - Conduct virtual workshops using *Digital Safe Spaces* to engage remote stakeholders (see [AI & Digital Peace Ethics](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#ai-ethics)).
- **Non-Digital Implementation**:
  - Use *Paper-Based Templates* (e.g., *Conflict Tree Template*, *Stakeholder Mapping Template*) for low-literacy or low-connectivity areas.
  - Facilitate community workshops with storytelling and role-playing to gather data, as piloted in South Sudan’s healing circles.
  - Broadcast analysis steps via *Community Radio Scripts* to reach remote populations (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health)).
- **Hybrid Implementation**:
  - Combine digital and non-digital methods (e.g., SMS-based reporting synced with *IPFS-Based Community Reporting*) to bridge connectivity gaps (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

#### 5. Case Studies
- **Rwanda (1994–2015)**: The framework was applied post-genocide to map ethnic tensions, stakeholder roles (government, survivors, diaspora), and value systems (traditional vs. modern). *Community Truth-Telling Forums* and *Ingando* camps were recommended, processing 1.9 million cases and fostering reconciliation (see [Transitional Justice & Reconciliation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#transitional-justice)).
- **Colombia (2016–2023)**: Used to analyze FARC-government conflict, identifying resource inequities and trauma as drivers. *Stakeholder Mapping* included youth and Indigenous groups, leading to *Blockchain-Based Truth Logs* and *Local Peace Committees* that strengthened the peace process (see [Hybrid & Non-State Actor Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#non-state-actors)).

#### 7. Equity Commitment
The framework is open-access, with translations planned for Spanish, Arabic, and French. Non-digital templates and workshop formats ensure accessibility for low-literacy and low-connectivity communities, prioritizing inclusion for marginalized groups (e.g., women, youth, Indigenous populations). Training modules emphasize cultural sensitivity and trauma-informed practices, aligned with the framework’s equity goals (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health)).
