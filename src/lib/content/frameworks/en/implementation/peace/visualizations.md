# Visualizations for Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework

Visual representations play a crucial role in communicating complex peace and conflict dynamics. The following visualizations provide stakeholders with accessible entry points to understand the framework's multi-dimensional and interconnected approaches.

## Key Framework Visualizations

### Peace Governance Architecture

![Peace Governance Architecture](/images/frameworks/peace/governance-architecture-en.svg)

This visualization maps the multi-level architecture of peace governance from local to global scales. It illustrates how governance structures at different levels interact through vertical coordination pathways and information flows. The diagram shows four distinct governance levels:
- Global governance institutions and normative frameworks
- Regional organizations and cross-border mechanisms
- National government bodies and integration frameworks
- Local and community-based peace systems

Feedback loops on both sides demonstrate how innovation and knowledge flow not just top-down but also bottom-up, with local experiences informing global policy.

### Implementation Timeline Roadmap

![Implementation Timeline Roadmap](/images/frameworks/peace/implementation-roadmap-en.svg)

This roadmap outlines the phased implementation approach for peace governance over a 10-year horizon. It presents:
- Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Foundation Building - establishing local peace committees and early warning networks
- Phase 2 (Years 3-5): Systems Development - creating regional frameworks and transitional justice mechanisms
- Phase 3 (Years 5-10): Full Integration - implementing global peace infrastructure and cooperative security arrangements

Each phase includes key milestones and success indicators to track progress and ensure accountability throughout implementation.

### Multi-Track Peace Engagement Flowchart

![Multi-Track Peace Engagement Flowchart](/images/frameworks/peace/multi-track-engagement-en.svg)

Based on the Diamond Model of Multi-Track Diplomacy, this flowchart illustrates the nine interconnected tracks of peacebuilding engagement:
1. Official Diplomacy (governments, UN institutions)
2. Non-governmental professional engagement (think tanks, international NGOs)
3. Business & Private Sector involvement
4. Community & Grassroots initiatives
5. Research & Education contributions
6. Activism & Advocacy efforts
7. Religious & Faith-Based approaches
8. Funding & Philanthropy support
9. Media & Communication channels

The flowchart demonstrates how these diverse tracks interact around shared peace objectives, with both direct engagement (solid lines) and coordination pathways (dashed lines).

### Peace-Climate-Migration Nexus

![Peace-Climate-Migration Nexus](/images/frameworks/peace/climate-migration-nexus-en.svg)

This Venn diagram illustrates the critical interconnections between climate change, migration patterns, and peace/conflict dynamics. It shows:
- The climate-induced migration overlap
- Climate-conflict connections (water wars, land degradation)
- Migration-conflict interactions (host community tensions)
- The central "nexus governance" requiring integrated approaches

Surrounding the diagram are governance components for prevention, response, and transformation, highlighting feedback loops between these intervention types.

### Digital Peace Infrastructure Map

![Digital Peace Infrastructure Map](/images/frameworks/peace/digital-infrastructure-en.svg)

This network diagram maps the technological ecosystem supporting peace governance. It visualizes four key components:
1. Early Warning Systems (sensor networks, analysis engines, alert systems)
2. Communication Platforms (dialogue tools, translation services, mediation support)
3. Documentation & Verification Systems (evidence collection, verification, secure archives)
4. Coordination & Implementation Tools (resource management, stakeholder engagement, tracking systems)

The central Peace Data Coordination Hub connects these systems, with ethical AI safeguards as the foundation.

### Conflict Transformation Timeline

![Conflict Transformation Timeline](/images/frameworks/peace/conflict-transformation-timeline-en.svg)

This timeline charts the typical progression of conflict dynamics and intervention points, from pre-conflict conditions through escalation, violent conflict, de-escalation, and post-conflict to sustainable peace. For each phase, it outlines:
- Characteristic dynamics and indicators
- Appropriate intervention strategies
- Governance needs and approaches

The timeline helps practitioners identify current conflict status and select stage-appropriate interventions.

## Analytical Visualizations

### SDG Alignment Chart

![SDG Alignment Chart](/images/frameworks/peace/sdg-alignment-en.svg)

This chart maps how the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework aligns with and contributes to multiple Sustainable Development Goals. It highlights:
- SDG 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) as the central focus
- Strong alignment with SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 17 (Partnerships)
- Secondary connections to SDGs 1, 4, 6, 11, and 15
- Framework components linked to specific SDG targets

The visualization demonstrates the framework's integrated approach to sustainable development through peace.

### Neural Network Analysis of Conflict Dynamics

![Neural Network Analysis of Conflict Dynamics](/images/frameworks/peace/neural-network-conflict-dynamics-en.svg)

This technical visualization illustrates how computational approaches can reveal complex patterns in conflict systems. The neural network diagram shows:
- Input nodes representing conflict factors (economic inequality, resource scarcity, etc.)
- Hidden layers for pattern recognition and feature abstraction
- Output nodes predicting conflict outcomes (violent escalation, peace opportunity, etc.)

The right panel highlights four analytical approaches: causal factor networks, intervention impact modeling, tipping point analysis, and temporal evolution patterns.

### Spiral Dynamics in Conflict and Peace (Planned)

[Spiral Dynamics in Conflict and Peace](https://www.spiralize.org/peace)

This interactive HTML visualization explores how developmental value systems influence conflict and peacebuilding. Based on Spiral Dynamics theory, it maps eight value systems (represented by colors):
- Purple (Tribal/Magical): Focused on safety, kinship, and tribal belonging
- Red (Power/Impulsive): Centered on power, dominance, and survival
- Blue (Order/Mythic): Organized around absolute truth and principles
- Orange (Achievement/Rational): Driven by achievement and progress
- Green (Pluralistic/Sensitive): Focused on equality and inclusivity
- Yellow (Systemic/Integrative): Emphasizing flexibility and systems thinking
- Turquoise (Holistic/Global): Oriented toward global consciousness

The visualization provides strategies for communicating across different value systems and designing developmentally-appropriate peace processes.

## Technical Interactive Visualizations

### Network Analysis of Peace Actors

This interactive visualization allows users to explore the complex relationships between different actors in peace processes across multiple contexts. The network analysis reveals:

- **Formal-Informal Actor Networks**: Connections between official institutions and grassroots initiatives, showing information flows between diplomatic channels and community-based efforts
- **Resource Flow Mapping**: How funding and support move through the peacebuilding ecosystem, highlighting gaps and efficient pathways
- **Influence Analysis**: Power relationships between key decision-makers and opinion leaders, revealing leverage points for promoting peace
- **Trust Relationship Matrices**: Trust levels between conflict parties, identifying where trust-building efforts should be focused

The visualization helps practitioners identify stakeholders, optimize resources, build bridges between divided communities, and develop strategic interventions that leverage existing networks.

### Geographic Information System (GIS) Applications

This interactive mapping application provides spatial analysis of conflict dynamics and peace infrastructure. Users can explore multiple visualization layers:

- **Resource Conflict Hotspots**: Regions experiencing tensions over scarce resources like water, land, and minerals
- **Peace Infrastructure Distribution**: The global distribution of peace governance mechanisms, highlighting capacities and gaps
- **Cross-Border Dynamics**: Population movements across borders, including forced displacement and migration
- **Climate-Migration Projections**: Forward-looking scenarios based on climate models showing projected displacement risks

The GIS tool helps identify geographic patterns in conflict dynamics, assess peace infrastructure distribution, understand cross-border movements, and prepare for future climate-migration scenarios.

### Systems Dynamics Models

These advanced visualizations apply systems thinking to peace and conflict, revealing complex relationships, feedback loops, and intervention points. The models include:

- **Feedback Loop Diagrams**: Visualizing reinforcing and balancing loops within conflict-peace systems
- **Stock and Flow Models**: Mapping how resources, grievances, and capacities accumulate or deplete over time
- **Leverage Point Identification**: Identifying high-impact intervention points for maximum effect
- **Resilience Factor Mapping**: Revealing elements that strengthen a peace system's ability to withstand shocks

These models help practitioners identify root causes, design targeted interventions, anticipate unintended consequences, ensure policy coherence, and understand how conflict dynamics might evolve over time.

!NOTE: We could use your help to make this visualization functioning. It is implemented as svelte components. [Check out the framework repository at https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFramework/governance-framework-site/tree/main/src/lib/components/Systems]
