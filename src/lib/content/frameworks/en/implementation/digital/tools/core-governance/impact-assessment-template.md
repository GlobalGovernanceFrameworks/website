# Digital Commons Framework: Impact Assessment Template

**Estimated Reading Time**: 15 minutes

**Purpose**: This template provides a structured framework for assessing the impact of Digital Commons Framework implementations at the Local Citizen Node, Regional Hub, or Global Council levels. Drawing on the methodology outlined in Appendix K: Impact Assessment Framework, it offers practical tools to measure social, cultural, governance, and environmental outcomes of digital commons initiatives. Designed for diverse contexts and varying resource levels, it supports evidence-based adaptation and continuous improvement while ensuring accountability to communities and alignment with Core Principles.

## Overview
Impact assessment is fundamental to the Digital Commons Framework's commitment to continuous improvement, transparency, and community benefit. This template helps you systematically evaluate how your implementation affects various dimensions of community life, digital equity, and resource governance.

**Why conduct impact assessments?**
- **Accountability**: Demonstrate how digital commons activities affect communities
- **Improvement**: Identify strengths and areas needing enhancement
- **Learning**: Generate insights to share across the framework
- **Adaptation**: Ensure alignment with evolving community needs
- **Evidence**: Build a case for continued support and expansion

**When to use this template:**
- **Baseline Assessment**: At the start of implementation (recommended within first 3 months)
- **Regular Evaluation**: Annually at minimum
- **Major Milestones**: After significant changes or expansion
- **Funding Reports**: When reporting to supporters or applying for resources
- **Crisis Recovery**: Following disruptions to measure resilience

This template supports multiple assessment approaches based on your resources and context:
- **Path A (Minimal)**: Community dialogue-based assessment with simple documentation
- **Path B (Basic)**: Mixed methods using surveys and basic data collection
- **Path C (Standard)**: Comprehensive mixed methods with quantitative and qualitative data
- **Path D (Advanced)**: Sophisticated measurement with longitudinal tracking and advanced analytics

## Low-Resource Implementation Guide

For communities with limited time, expertise, or resources, this simplified approach focuses on essential elements:

### Essential Questions Approach
If you cannot complete the full template, focus on these core questions:

1. **Access and Inclusion**:
   - Who has gained access to digital resources, and who remains excluded?
   - Has participation in governance become more inclusive or remained limited?

2. **Benefits and Harms**:
   - What positive changes has the community experienced?
   - Have any negative consequences occurred, and for whom?

3. **Cultural Respect**:
   - How have local cultural practices and knowledge been affected?
   - Do community members feel their culture is respected and strengthened?

4. **Governance Quality**:
   - Are decisions made transparently and inclusively?
   - Do community members feel represented in governance?

5. **Economic Effects**:
   - What economic benefits or costs have resulted?
   - How equitably are resources and benefits distributed?

6. **Priorities for Improvement**:
   - What changes would most improve community outcomes?
   - What resources or support would help address challenges?

### Community Dialogue Method
1. Gather 10-15 diverse community members for a 2-3 hour discussion
2. Ask the essential questions, ensuring all voices are heard
3. Document key points using simple recording methods:
   - Audio recording with permission
   - Note-taking by a designated scribe
   - Visual documentation (drawings, charts) for key points
4. Summarize findings and verify with participants
5. Identify 3-5 priority actions
6. Document in Field-Test Logbook

### Visual Assessment Option
For communities preferring visual communication:
- Use the Impact Mapping Canvas (available in PDF)
- Create a visual representation of:
  - Community members (showing who benefits/participates)
  - Digital resources (showing what's accessible and by whom)
  - Outcomes (showing changes experienced)
  - Challenges (showing barriers and problems)
  - Actions (showing priorities for improvement)

### Minimal Documentation Format
One-page assessment summary:
```
IMPACT ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
Node: [Name] - [Date]
Participation: [Who was involved in assessment]
Strengths: [Top 3 positive impacts]
Challenges: [Top 3 problems or barriers]
Benefits: [Who benefits and how]
Exclusions: [Who remains excluded and why]
Priority Actions: [Top 3-5 next steps]
```

---

## Verification Protocol

To ensure assessment quality and credibility, consider these verification approaches:

### Internal Verification
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Include at least 3 different stakeholder groups in assessment
- **Data Triangulation**: Use at least 2 different methods to confirm key findings
- **Community Validation**: Present findings to broader community for feedback
- **Documentation Review**: Examine Field-Test Logbook and other records

### Regional Hub Verification
- Submit assessment to Regional Hub for review
