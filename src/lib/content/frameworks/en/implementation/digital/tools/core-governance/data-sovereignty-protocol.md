## Overview
The Data Sovereignty Protocol empowers communities to maintain control over their data—whether traditional knowledge, personal information, environmental observations, or community resources—within the Digital Commons Framework. This protocol ensures that data governance aligns with local values, needs, and priorities while enabling beneficial data sharing and use.

Data sovereignty is essential for:
- **Preventing exploitation** of community information
- **Preserving cultural knowledge** with appropriate protections
- **Ensuring equitable benefits** from data use
- **Building trust** in digital systems
- **Enabling self-determination** in the digital realm

The protocol supports diverse implementation contexts:
- **Indigenous communities** protecting traditional knowledge
- **Rural villages** sharing agricultural or health data
- **Urban neighborhoods** governing mobility or resource information
- **Specialized communities** managing profession-specific knowledge

Key outcomes include:
- **100% community control** over data governance by 2035
- **80% of data storage** on community-controlled or federated systems by 2032
- **95% compliance** with community-defined sharing protocols by 2030
- **70% of data value** returned to source communities by 2035

This protocol balances sovereignty with responsible sharing, recognizing that appropriate data exchange is vital for cross-commons synergies with environmental and economic systems.

## Core Sovereignty Principles
These five foundational principles guide all data sovereignty implementations:

### 1. Community Authority
- Communities have the **inherent right** to govern data about their people, places, and practices
- All data decisions require **community consent** through established governance processes
- Data sovereignty applies to **all forms of data**, from traditional knowledge to sensor readings
- Authority extends across the **full data lifecycle** from collection to deletion

**Implementation Example**: Canada's Indigenous node requires approval by elder council for all data collection, with governance documented through both audio recordings and written records to respect oral traditions.

### 2. Collective Benefit
- Data use must **primarily benefit** the source community
- Benefits include knowledge, resources, opportunities, and recognition
- Value generated from data should **flow back** to the community
- Harmful uses are prohibited **regardless of potential benefits** to others

**Implementation Example**: Kenya's agricultural node established a data dividend system, where 70% of value created from farming data returns to local farmers, funding community projects and infrastructure.

### 3. Contextual Integrity
- Data maintains its **proper meaning and context** through governance
- Cultural, historical, and local context **remains attached** to data
- Sovereignty includes control over **interpretation and framing**
- Data sharing preserves **original context and attribution**

**Implementation Example**: New Zealand's Māori node developed context preservation metadata standards, ensuring cultural narratives retained connection to specific tribal traditions and perspectives.

### 4. Layered Access
- Access follows the principle of **minimum necessary disclosure**
- Communities define **graduated access levels** reflecting sensitivity
- Access decisions consider **purpose, duration, and extent**
- Different elements of datasets may have **different access requirements**

**Implementation Example**: Brazil's node implemented four-tier access control for forest knowledge: public information, community-only details, family-specific data, and sacred knowledge with elder-only access.

### 5. Revocable Permission
- Data sharing permissions are **never permanent**
- Communities retain the right to **revoke access** at any time
- Regular **review and renewal** of data permissions
- Changes in circumstances may **trigger automatic revocation**

**Implementation Example**: Senegal's health data node implemented annual permission reviews with opt-out options at any time, documenting decisions through both SMS verification and community meeting minutes.

## Data Classification System
A structured approach to categorizing data based on sensitivity and appropriate governance:

### Classification Levels
1. **Public Domain (Level 1)**
   - Freely shareable without restrictions
   - No sensitivity concerns
   - Maximum accessibility prioritized
   - Example: Aggregated crop yield statistics

2. **Community Controlled (Level 2)**
   - Shareable under defined conditions
   - Moderate sensitivity
   - Managed access with attribution requirements
   - Example: Local farming techniques

3. **Protected (Level 3)**
   - Restricted sharing with specific protocols
   - High sensitivity
   - Formal agreements required for access
   - Example: Traditional healing knowledge

4. **Sacred/Restricted (Level 4)**
   - Minimal or no external sharing
   - Highest sensitivity
   - Governed by specialized cultural protocols
   - Example: Ceremonial knowledge with spiritual significance

### Classification Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: Community-led evaluation using the Data Sensitivity Assessment Tool
2. **Collective Decision**: Vote or consensus determination of classification level
3. **Documentation**: Recording classification decisions in Field-Test Logbook
4. **Regular Review**: Reassessment at defined intervals (minimum annually)

### Supporting Tools
- **Data Sensitivity Assessment Tool**: Structured questionnaire for evaluating sensitivity
- **Classification Matrix**: Visual guide mapping data types to suggested classifications
- **Protocol Templates**: Standard frameworks for each classification level

**Example Implementation**: Rwanda's node developed pictorial data classification cards in three languages, enabling non-literate community members to participate in classification decisions, assigning green, yellow, orange, and red colors to denote sensitivity levels.
