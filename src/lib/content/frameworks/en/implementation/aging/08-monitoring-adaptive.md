Effective aging support requires sophisticated monitoring systems that measure success through elder-defined criteria rather than institutional metrics. Traditional evaluation approaches often measure cost reduction rather than elder thriving, compliance rather than community satisfaction, and administrative efficiency rather than elder agency. Monitoring and adaptive management creates elder-led evaluation systems that measure comprehensive wellbeing while enabling rapid adaptation based on community feedback and changing needs.
