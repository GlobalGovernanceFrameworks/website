# Hydrological Justice Assessment Framework
## Measuring Systemic Equity and Ecosystem Health in Water Governance

### 🌊 Assessment Overview

The Hydrological Justice Assessment provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating whether water governance systems serve justice, equity, and planetary healing. Unlike traditional water assessments that focus on technical performance, this tool examines root causes of water injustice while measuring progress toward transformative governance that serves both communities and ecosystems.

**Core Purpose**: Systematically assess how well water governance addresses historical inequities, current injustices, and future sustainability while building community power and healing damaged relationships between humans and water systems.

**Assessment Philosophy**:
- **Systemic Analysis**: Examines root causes rather than symptoms of water challenges
- **Intersectional Approach**: Considers how multiple forms of oppression interact in water systems
- **Community-Controlled**: Communities lead assessment and determine how results are used
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Evaluates health of both human and more-than-human water relationships
- **Transformative Orientation**: Measures progress toward justice rather than just access
