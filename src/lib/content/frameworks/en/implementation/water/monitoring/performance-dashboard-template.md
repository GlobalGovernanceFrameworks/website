# Performance Dashboard Template
## Community-Controlled Water Governance Monitoring

### 📊 Overview

The Performance Dashboard Template provides comprehensive frameworks for real-time monitoring of water governance transformation while maintaining community ownership of evaluation processes. This dashboard integrates technical indicators with community-defined success measures, enabling adaptive management that serves community empowerment and water justice.

**Core Innovation**: Combines automated data collection with participatory evaluation, ensuring monitoring serves community learning and improvement rather than external accountability or surveillance.

**Key Principles**:
- **Community Ownership**: Communities control what is measured and how data is used
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Immediate feedback enabling rapid response and improvement
- **Holistic Assessment**: Integration of technical, social, environmental, and cultural indicators
- **Transparent Governance**: Open data and democratic oversight of monitoring systems
- **Learning Orientation**: Evaluation serving community learning rather than external judgment
