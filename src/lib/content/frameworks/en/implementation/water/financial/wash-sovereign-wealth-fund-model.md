# WASH Sovereign Wealth Fund Model
## Innovative Financing for Community-Controlled Water Governance

### 🌊 Overview

The WASH Sovereign Wealth Fund (WSWF) represents a transformative approach to financing universal water and sanitation access through sustainable, community-controlled, and democratically governed national wealth funds. Unlike traditional sovereign wealth funds that often serve elite interests, WSWFs prioritize community empowerment, regenerative infrastructure, and long-term sustainability while building national water security and resilience.

**Core Innovation**: Combines sovereign wealth fund financial sustainability with community ownership principles, creating perpetual funding for water justice while building community wealth and democratic control.

**Key Principles**:
- **Democratic Governance**: Community representation in fund governance and decision-making
- **Regenerative Investment**: Funding approaches that heal rather than exploit ecosystems
- **Intergenerational Justice**: Long-term fund sustainability serving future generations
- **Community Ownership**: Priority for cooperative and community-controlled projects
- **Climate Resilience**: Investment strategies adapted to climate change impacts
