The Adaptive Universal Basic Income Framework does not operate in isolation—it is fundamentally integrated with the "Treaty for Our Only Home" governance architecture, leveraging all five Treaty pillars to create a robust, globally-coordinated approach to economic transformation. This integration transforms AUBI from a national policy experiment into a component of planetary governance reform, ensuring resilience, accountability, and cultural sensitivity at unprecedented scales.

## <a id="comprehensive-dependency-matrix"></a>The Comprehensive Dependency Matrix

AUBI's strength lies not in standalone implementation, but in systematic integration with Treaty mechanisms that provide financing, verification, governance, and crisis response capabilities. Each AUBI component connects with multiple Treaty pillars, creating redundant support systems that prevent single points of failure.

### Primary Integration Architecture

| **AUBI Component** | **Primary Treaty Pillar** | **Core Mechanisms** | **Secondary Support** | **Crisis Integration** |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Financing & Currency Stability** | P4 (Planetary Health) | Carbon pricing, resource taxes, Sovereignty Bargains, Hearts stabilization fund | P1 (economic modeling), P3 (conflict zone funding) | Emergency fund coordination, cross-border capital controls |
| **Verification & Fraud Prevention** | P2 (Global Forensic Corps) | Love Ledger validation, contribution verification, adversarial testing, anti-corruption audits | P5 (ethical oversight), P1 (system testing) | Crisis evidence gathering, emergency verification protocols |
| **Implementation & Iteration** | P1 (Reform Accelerator Labs) | Pilot testing, legislative templates, failure analysis, adaptive protocols | P3 (conflict adaptation), P5 (ethical review) | Rapid policy adaptation, emergency implementation |
| **Cultural Ethics & Adaptation** | P5 (Ethical Infrastructure, Foresight Labs) | Cultural sensitivity protocols, spiritual care recognition, scenario planning, values preservation | P2 (cultural authenticity verification), P3 (minority protection) | Values preservation during crisis, cultural continuity |
| **Governance & Conflict Resolution** | P3 (Humanitarian Stability) | Participatory audits, conflict zone adaptation, crisis mediation, refugee support | P1 (governance innovation), P5 (ethical mediation) | Multi-region failure coordination, emergency governance |
| **System Stress Testing** | P5 (Office of the Adversary) | Governance War Games, elite capture simulation, cultural conflict scenarios | P2 (security assessment), P1 (system improvement) | Vulnerability assessment, crisis preparedness |

### Redundant Safety Networks

This multi-pillar integration creates three levels of redundancy:

1. **Primary Support**: Each AUBI function has a designated Treaty pillar providing core support
2. **Secondary Backup**: Alternative Treaty mechanisms can assume responsibilities if primary systems fail  
3. **Crisis Coordination**: Emergency protocols enable rapid response and resource reallocation across pillars
