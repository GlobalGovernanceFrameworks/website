**Framework Development**: This system visualization framework represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems, integrating user interface design principles, data visualization best practices, accessibility standards, and cross-cultural communication approaches while prioritizing community sovereignty and cultural adaptation.

**Research Foundation**: The visualization framework draws from established principles in universal design, information architecture, interactive data visualization, and community-controlled communication while creating innovative integration mechanisms for complex system representation across diverse cultural contexts.

**Implementation Guidance**: The visualization framework provides research-based guidance for visual communication and stakeholder engagement. Local implementation should involve consultation with user experience designers, cultural communication specialists, accessibility experts, and community leaders familiar with specific visual communication traditions and technological contexts.
