# Cost-Benefit Analysis Model

## Overview
The **Cost-Benefit Analysis Model** enables jurisdictions to evaluate the financial and social impacts of justice system reforms under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. It provides a structured methodology to quantify costs (e.g., training, infrastructure) and benefits (e.g., reduced case backlogs, increased trust), ensuring evidence-based decision-making and resource optimization, as outlined in the [Implementation Mechanisms](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#04-implementation-mechanisms) section. The model is adaptable to diverse jurisdictional contexts and resource levels, supporting the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035.

**Purpose**: To guide National Implementation Units and Regional Justice Hubs in assessing the economic and social viability of justice reforms to prioritize investments and secure funding.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, policymakers, financial analysts, community stakeholders, and funding agencies.

**Format**: Modular model with principles, step-by-step methodology, analysis templates, data collection methods, monitoring metrics, and adaptation guidelines.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/cost-benefit-analysis-model-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions planned by Year 2 (2027).

## Instructions

7. **Adapt as Needed**: Modify up to 20% of the model (e.g., adjust cost categories) with approval from Regional Justice Hubs ([Appendices](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#11-appendices)).
8. **Seek Support**: Submit analysis plans to Regional Justice Hubs for technical assistance or funding via [globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com].

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Principles
The following principles guide the analysis, ensuring alignment with the framework’s commitment to equity, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making:

- **Comprehensiveness**: Account for all direct and indirect costs and benefits, including social outcomes, targeting 100% coverage in analyses by Year 3 (2028).
- **Equity Focus**: Prioritize benefits for marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous, low-income), targeting ≥50% of benefits directed to these groups by Year 4 (2029).
- **Transparency**: Document assumptions, data sources, and methodologies publicly, respecting confidentiality where needed.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Incorporate costs and benefits relevant to local traditions, especially indigenous practices, with stakeholder input.
- **Long-Term Perspective**: Evaluate impacts over the 10-year implementation period (2025–2035), using discount rates to reflect future value.
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground analyses in data from the [Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf).
- **Stakeholder Inclusion**: Engage communities in defining benefits, targeting ≥50% marginalized group representation in consultations by Year 3.
- **Adaptability**: Allow flexibility to accommodate jurisdictional variations in resources and priorities.
