# Stakeholder Simulation Guide

## Overview
The **Stakeholder Simulation Guide** equips jurisdictions with a methodology to conduct role-playing simulations that engage diverse stakeholders in justice system reforms under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. By simulating real-world scenarios, the guide fosters consensus, tests reform strategies, and builds trust among stakeholders, as outlined in the [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#07-stakeholder-engagement) section. It is adaptable to various cultural and resource contexts, prioritizing marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous, youth) to support the framework’s goals of **25% increased public trust**, **80% fair access**, and **70% case resolution** by 2035.

**Purpose**: To guide National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, and community leaders in using simulations to enhance stakeholder collaboration and refine justice reform strategies.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, community organizations, indigenous leaders, youth advocates, policymakers, and facilitators.

**Format**: Modular guide with principles, simulation methodology, scenario templates, facilitation tools, monitoring metrics, and adaptation guidelines.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/stakeholder-simulation-guide-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions planned by Year 2 (2027).
