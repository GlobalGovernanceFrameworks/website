# Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template

## Overview
The **Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template** enables jurisdictions to systematically assess the progress and impact of justice system reforms under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. It provides a structured rubric to evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) related to public trust, access to justice, case resolution, stakeholder engagement, technology utilization, cost-effectiveness, and equity impact, as outlined in the [Monitoring and Accountability](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#06-monitoring-accountability) section. Enhanced with technology, cost-efficiency, and equity metrics, the template supports data-driven decision-making, transparency, and continuous improvement, ensuring alignment with the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035. It is adaptable to diverse jurisdictional contexts and resource levels.

**Purpose**: To monitor implementation progress, evaluate outcomes, and provide actionable insights for refining justice system reforms.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, policymakers, community stakeholders, and monitoring teams.

**Format**: Modular rubric with KPIs, scoring criteria, data collection methods, qualitative reflections, and adaptation guidelines.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions planned by Year 2 (2027).

## Instructions
1. **Customize the Rubric**: Adapt KPIs and scoring criteria (up to 20% modification) to reflect local priorities, with approval from Regional Justice Hubs ([Appendices](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#11-appendices)).
2. **Collect Data**: Use specified methods (e.g., surveys, case records) to gather quantitative and qualitative data, ensuring inclusivity of marginalized groups.
3. **Score Performance**: Apply the rubric to assign scores (0–3) for each KPI based on evidence, calculating totals for each category.
4. **Reflect Qualitatively**: Provide insights on challenges, successes, and contextual factors to complement quantitative scores.
5. **Report Findings**: Submit results to Regional Justice Hubs for integration into the framework’s metrics dashboard ([Monitoring and Accountability](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#06-monitoring-accountability)).
6. **Develop Action Plans**: Use scores and reflections to prioritize improvements, aligning with the [Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.pdf).
7. **Seek Support**: Request technical assistance or funding from Regional Justice Hubs via [globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com].
