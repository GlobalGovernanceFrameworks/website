# Advocacy Playbook

## Overview
The **Advocacy Playbook** equips jurisdictions with strategies and tools to build support for justice system reforms under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. It focuses on mobilizing stakeholders, raising awareness, addressing opposition, managing advocacy risks, and amplifying success stories to secure policy and funding commitments, as outlined in the [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#07-stakeholder-engagement) section. Enhanced with opposition engagement, risk management, and storytelling, the playbook is adaptable to diverse cultural and political contexts, ensuring inclusive advocacy that prioritizes marginalized groups and aligns with the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035.

**Purpose**: To guide National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, and community advocates in designing and executing effective advocacy campaigns to drive justice system transformation.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, community organizations, indigenous leaders, youth advocates, and policymakers.

**Format**: Modular playbook with advocacy strategies, stakeholder targeting, opposition engagement, risk management, success storytelling, communication templates, monitoring metrics, and adaptation guidelines.
