# Indigenous Justice Integration Template

## Overview
The **Indigenous Justice Integration Template** enables jurisdictions to incorporate indigenous justice practices into their legal systems under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. Indigenous justice emphasizes community-based, restorative, and culturally grounded approaches, complementing formal legal processes. Enhanced with intergenerational justice strategies, expanded conflict resolution mechanisms, and digital documentation guidance, this template provides principles, a step-by-step integration process, stakeholder engagement strategies, and monitoring metrics to ensure respectful, inclusive, and effective integration, as outlined in the [Legal Framework](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#03-legal-framework) section. It is adaptable to diverse indigenous traditions and jurisdictional contexts, fostering equitable justice systems.

**Purpose**: To guide jurisdictions in harmonizing indigenous justice practices with formal legal frameworks, enhancing cultural sensitivity, public trust, and access to justice, contributing to the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, indigenous leaders, policymakers, and community stakeholders.

**Format**: Modular template with principles, integration steps, intergenerational focus, conflict resolution, digital documentation, stakeholder engagement, monitoring metrics, and adaptation guidelines.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/indigenous-justice-integration-template-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions, including indigenous languages, planned by Year 2 (2027).
