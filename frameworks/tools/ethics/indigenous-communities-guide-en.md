# Rights of Beings for Indigenous Communities

## A Guide to the Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework

## Welcome

*The circle of life has many voices. For thousands of years, Indigenous communities worldwide have listened to them all.*

Welcome to this guide on the Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework. This resource has been created specifically for Indigenous peoples and communities who may be interested in exploring how this framework relates to traditional knowledge systems and values.

Many Indigenous nations have long recognized the rights and personhood of non-human beings—mountains, rivers, animals, plants, and sacred places. This understanding of a world filled with relatives rather than resources offers profound wisdom in a time of global crisis.

The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework seeks to expand recognition of rights beyond humans to include other beings—something many Indigenous cultures have practiced since time immemorial. This guide explores how your community might engage with, influence, or utilize this framework in ways that strengthen rather than diminish Indigenous sovereignty and traditional knowledge.

**This guide was developed in partnership with Indigenous knowledge keepers, leaders, and communities from diverse nations and regions worldwide.**

## Our Shared Journey

### Where This Framework Comes From

The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework emerged from growing recognition that our current ethical systems are failing to protect the living world. It draws inspiration from diverse sources—including the deep wisdom of Indigenous traditions that have maintained balanced relationships with other beings across millennia.

### Where Indigenous Knowledge Fits

Indigenous knowledge is not merely a "source" or "influence" for this framework, but a fully legitimate and often more time-tested ethical system in its own right. The framework acknowledges that many Indigenous cultures have sophisticated systems for recognizing the rights, personhood, and agency of non-human beings.

### Our Approach to This Guide

This guide is offered with humility and respect, recognizing that:

- Each Indigenous nation has its own unique relationship with the living world
- Traditional knowledge belongs to the communities who have developed it
- There is no single "Indigenous perspective" but many diverse traditions
- The wisdom of Indigenous elders often exceeds modern frameworks
- Engagement must support, not undermine, Indigenous sovereignty

## Framework Foundations

### Core Principles in Plain Language

The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework is built on the understanding that:

1. **All beings have value** - Not just humans, but animals, plants, ecosystems, and even emerging beings like artificial intelligence deserve ethical consideration.

2. **Rights should match capacity** - Different beings deserve different kinds of rights based on what they can experience and how they fit into the web of life.

3. **Responsibilities come with rights** - Rights are not just about protection but about maintaining proper relationships.

4. **Different worldviews matter** - The framework tries to work with different cultural perspectives rather than imposing a single view.

5. **Traditional knowledge offers wisdom** - Ancient ways of knowing provide essential guidance for ethical relationships.

### Key Framework Elements

The framework includes:

- **Dynamic Rights Spectrum** - Recognition that rights exist across a continuum for different beings
- **Guardianship Councils** - Representation for beings who cannot speak in human forums
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration** - Protocols for respectfully incorporating traditional wisdom
- **Conflict Resolution Processes** - Methods for addressing tensions between different rights
- **Implementation Strategies** - Practical approaches for applying these principles

### Rights Categories

The framework recognizes several broad categories of rights-holders:

- **Humans** - Full rights and responsibilities as members of the human community
- **Animals** - Rights based on their capacity for feeling and relationship
- **Ecosystems** - Rights of rivers, mountains, forests, and other natural entities
- **Digital Beings** - Emerging considerations for artificial intelligence

## Connecting Ancient Wisdom & Global Ethics

### Shared Understandings

Many Indigenous traditions already embrace core concepts that the framework is just beginning to recognize:

| **Indigenous Understanding** | **Framework Concept** | **Shared Value** |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Kinship with all beings | Expanded circle of moral consideration | Relationship beyond the human |
| Responsibilities to care for land | Guardianship for non-human entities | Duty of care for other beings |
| Everything has a spirit/life force | Graduated recognition of consciousness | Respect for many forms of existence |
| Seven generations thinking | Future beings consideration | Responsibility to those not yet born |
| Ceremonial relationship renewal | Rights relationship maintenance | Ongoing commitment to balance |

### Complementary Strengths

| **Indigenous Knowledge Systems** | **Framework Approach** | **Potential Synergy** |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Place-based, specific knowledge | General principles, global scope | Principles grounded in lived reality |
| Intergenerational wisdom transmission | Documented, codified approaches | Multiple ways of preserving knowledge |
| Ceremonial and spiritual dimensions | Legal and governance focus | Complete approach honoring seen and unseen |
| Embedded in cultural practice | Focused on institutional adoption | Cultural and institutional transformation |
| Relationship-centered understanding | Rights-based articulation | Full expression of relational ethics |

### Potential Tensions

We acknowledge potential areas of tension that require careful navigation:

- Framework language may not fully capture spiritual dimensions
- Western legal concepts may not translate perfectly to traditional understandings
- Global approaches may miss important local and cultural nuances
- Written documentation differs from oral tradition transmission
- Institutional processes move at different pace than traditional decision-making

## Practical Applications

### Ecosystem Protection

**Mount Kaiwethu Sacred Forest Initiative**

*When mining threatened the sacred forest of Mount Kaiwethu, the Abadani people combined their traditional understanding of the mountain as an ancestor with the framework's ecosystem rights approach to establish legal protection for the entire ecosystem.*

**Application Approach:**
1. Documented spiritual and cultural relationship with the forest
2. Mapped traditional guardianship practices and knowledge
3. Established formal Guardianship Council with elder leadership
4. Combined traditional protocols with legal protection mechanisms
5. Created management plan integrating traditional and scientific approaches

### Animal Relationship

**Coastal Whale Relation Restoration**

*The Makah Nation integrated traditional whaling practices with contemporary rights concepts, developing an approach that honored their cultural connection to whales while incorporating modern conservation requirements.*

**Application Approach:**
1. Elders council articulated traditional relationship with whales
2. Community developed contemporary whaling protocols
3. Traditional songs and ceremonies reintegrated into practice
4. Adaptive management incorporated population monitoring
5. Youth education connected cultural identity with responsibility

### Water Rights Implementation

## Addressing Common Concerns

### "Will this undermine our traditional knowledge systems?"

**Our Approach:** The framework is designed to support, not replace, Indigenous knowledge systems. Engagement is always optional and should be Indigenous-led, with communities determining what knowledge to share, how it is used, and maintaining control throughout the process.

### "Is this just another form of extraction?"

**Our Approach:** The framework explicitly rejects extractive approaches through its Indigenous Knowledge Integration Protocol, which requires proper consent, reciprocal benefit, appropriate compensation, and ongoing relationship rather than one-time exchanges.

### "How does this relate to existing rights frameworks?"

**Our Approach:** The framework is designed to complement and strengthen existing Indigenous rights mechanisms, including UNDRIP, treaty rights, and constitutional protections, not replace or compete with them.

### "Will this be used against our traditional practices?"

**Our Approach:** The framework respects cultural practices and traditional relationships with animals, plants, and ecosystems, recognizing that Indigenous relationships with other beings often involve both use and deep respect.
