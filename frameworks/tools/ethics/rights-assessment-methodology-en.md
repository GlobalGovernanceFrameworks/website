# Rights Assessment Methodology Handbook

## Introduction

This handbook provides comprehensive methodologies for assessing the rights status of diverse entities under the Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework. It offers structured protocols, evaluation criteria, and practical guidance for rights determination across human, animal, ecosystem, and technological domains.

The handbook follows the framework's Dynamic Rights Spectrum approach, recognizing that rights exist on a continuum related to consciousness, ecological significance, and relational importance. These methodologies balance scientific rigor with cultural sensitivity, enabling consistent assessment while respecting diverse worldviews.

## Core Assessment Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Evaluation
All rights determinations must be grounded in rigorous evidence appropriate to the entity type. Assessment should integrate multiple lines of evidence while acknowledging limitations and uncertainties.

### 2. Precautionary Approach
When evidence is inconclusive but suggests significant capacity for suffering or consciousness, assessments should err toward protection rather than exploitation.

### 3. Cultural Integration
Assessment methodologies must incorporate diverse knowledge systems including Indigenous, traditional, and scientific perspectives while maintaining consistent standards.

### 4. Transparency
Assessment processes must be fully documented with clear reasoning connecting evidence to determinations and transparent acknowledgment of uncertainties.

### 5. Regular Reassessment
Rights determinations are provisional and subject to revision as understanding evolves and new evidence emerges.
