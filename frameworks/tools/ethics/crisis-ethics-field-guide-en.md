# Crisis Ethics Field Guide

## QUICK START: TRIAGE PROTOCOL

**IF IMMEDIATE THREAT TO LIFE:**
1. Prioritize survival across all beings (human and non-human)
2. Document decisions using Rapid Documentation Card (p.24)
3. Engage crisis guardians if available

**IF SEVERE SUFFERING RISK:**
1. Apply Harm Minimization Protocol (p.8)
2. Implement temporary protective measures
3. Document using Rapid Assessment Form

**IF TIME PERMITS:**
Follow complete assessment pathway for your crisis type (see index on back cover)

## CORE PRINCIPLES FOR CRISIS ETHICS

1. **Preserve Life First**
   - Prioritize immediate survival needs across all categories of beings
   - Default to protection when rapid assessment is impossible

2. **Minimize Suffering**
   - Prevent avoidable suffering for all sentient beings
   - Apply proportional attention to suffering based on capacity and scale

3. **Maintain Transparency**
   - Document decisions even under pressure
   - Communicate rationale when possible

4. **Balance Immediate Action with Long-Term Impact**
   - Consider reversible vs. irreversible harms
   - Create space for fuller assessment when crisis stabilizes

5. **Respect Cultural Context**
   - Integrate local knowledge and values
   - Adapt implementation to cultural realities

                                                                                → NO → Local leadership available? → YES → Collaborate with leaders
                                                                                                                  → NO → Exercise best judgment
                                                                                                                          Document decisions
                                                                                                                          Prepare for review
