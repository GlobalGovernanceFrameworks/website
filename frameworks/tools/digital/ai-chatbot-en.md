# AI Chatbot for Tool Navigation Documentation: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 8 minutes

**Purpose**: This documentation describes the *AI Chatbot for Tool Navigation*, a digital tool designed to guide communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and stakeholders within the *Digital Commons Framework* to navigate and utilize the framework’s suite of tools and resources (e.g., Governance Simulator App, Health Dashboard). Rooted in inclusive commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s consensus-driven communication) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 16), the chatbot ensures accessibility in low-resource settings through offline capabilities, multilingual support, and formats like SMS and audio. It aims to enable 80% of node users to effectively access tools by 2035, fostering equitable and transparent engagement.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* empowers communities to govern digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons. The *AI Chatbot for Tool Navigation* is an open-source, ethical AI tool that simplifies access to the framework’s tools, guides users through tasks (e.g., starting a node, accessing health data), and provides tailored support. Designed for inclusivity, it supports low-literacy users, offline access, and 50 languages by 2030. It aims for:

- **Tool Adoption**: 80% of node users accessing tools via chatbot by 2035.
- **Equity**: 90% global access to navigation support by 2035.
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable interactions via blockchain by 2030.
- **Cultural Inclusion**: Support for Indigenous protocols and 100 languages by 2035.

**Chatbot Goals**:
- Streamline navigation of framework tools and resources.
- Provide personalized, accessible guidance for diverse users.
- Ensure ethical AI with community oversight.
- Enhance user confidence in digital commons participation.

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Strong Institutions).
