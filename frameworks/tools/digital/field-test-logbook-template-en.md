Appendix G: Field-Test Logbook Template provides a structured format for pilot regions to document their experiences implementing the Digital Commons Framework, capturing feedback, challenges, and successes. Rooted in historical commons practices, such as the Iroquois Confederacy's oral record-keeping and Elinor Ostrom's field research methodologies, this template enables systematic learning through practice. It builds on Appendix A: Pilot Onboarding and Appendix F: Minimal-Viable Node Quickstart by creating a feedback loop that improves the framework over time. From Aisha in Senegal documenting health data governance to Carlos in Brazil tracking farming app adoption, these logbooks generate valuable insights that Regional Digital Hubs and the Global Digital Commons Council can use to refine processes and address barriers. With both digital and offline formats, the template ensures all communities, regardless of technical resources, can contribute to the framework's evolution. The next section, Appendix H: FAQ for Tech-Skeptical Leaders, addresses common concerns about implementation.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The Field-Test Logbook Template facilitates systematic documentation of Local Citizen Node experiences, providing valuable feedback to improve the framework. It captures both qualitative insights (e.g., community responses, cultural adaptations) and quantitative metrics (e.g., participation rates, voting outcomes), creating an evidence base for refinement. Available in print and digital formats with multilingual options (50 languages by 2027), it ensures accessibility for diverse communities, from urban Singapore to rural Rwanda. Regional Digital Hubs analyze these logbooks quarterly, with findings shared globally to identify patterns and solutions. Success is measured by logbook completion (80% of pilot nodes submitting by 2028), insight generation (50 framework improvements based on logbook data by 2030), and community empowerment (70% of nodes reporting increased agency by 2028).
