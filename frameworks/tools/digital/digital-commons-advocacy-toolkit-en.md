# Digital Commons Advocacy Toolkit

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This toolkit equips advocates—community leaders, youth, Indigenous groups, policymakers, and organizations—with tools and strategies to promote the *Digital Commons Framework*, a system for governing digital resources (data, software, knowledge, infrastructure) as shared global commons. Rooted in historical commons governance (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 16), it provides templates, campaigns, and outreach methods to build support, engage stakeholders, and drive adoption. Designed for diverse contexts, it supports low-resource settings with accessible tools (e.g., SMS, posters) to ensure equitable, sustainable, and inclusive digital systems.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* reimagines digital resources as community-governed commons, ensuring equitable access, data sovereignty, and sustainability through decentralized, transparent systems. Advocacy is critical to scale its adoption, from local nodes to global policies. This toolkit provides practical tools—posters, social media posts, SMS campaigns, and workshops—to mobilize support, requiring minimal technical or financial resources. It aims for:

- **Global Reach**: 5,000 Local Citizen Nodes by 2035.
- **Participation**: 50% adult engagement in governance by 2035.
- **Equity**: 90% global access to digital resources by 2035.
- **Sustainability**: 80% renewable energy for infrastructure by 2035.

**Advocacy Goals**:
- Raise awareness of digital commons benefits.
- Engage diverse stakeholders (communities, governments, NGOs).
- Drive policy integration and node creation.
- Amplify marginalized voices, including Indigenous and youth.

**Policy Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Strong Institutions).
- Supports digital sovereignty, inclusion, and environmental goals.

## Why Advocate for the Framework?
Advocacy addresses urgent digital challenges and unlocks opportunities:

- **Challenges**:
  - **Monopolization**: 5 tech firms control 72% of cloud infrastructure; 3 AI developers dominate 85% of models.
  - **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack access, deepening inequality.
  - **Environmental Impact**: Digital systems emit 5% of global emissions; e-waste grows 4.5% annually.
  - **Data Exploitation**: 60% of data breaches involve personal data, risking privacy.
- **Opportunities**:
  - **Equity**: Decentralized systems ensure access for marginalized groups.
  - **Sovereignty**: Communities control data, reducing corporate dependence.
  - **Innovation**: Open-source ecosystems foster local entrepreneurship.
  - **Sustainability**: Renewable energy and ethical tech reduce environmental harm.

**Advocacy Benefits**:
- Build coalitions for policy change.
- Empower communities to govern their digital future.
- Position advocates as leaders in equitable tech.
