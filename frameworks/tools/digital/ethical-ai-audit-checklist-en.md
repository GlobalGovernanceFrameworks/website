# Ethical AI Audit Checklist: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This checklist enables communities to systematically evaluate Artificial Intelligence systems within the *Digital Commons Framework*, ensuring they uphold ethical standards, community values, and human rights. Designed for use by Local Citizen Nodes and the AI Governance Board, it provides structured assessment criteria requiring minimal technical expertise, with adaptations for varying resource contexts. Based on global AI ethics principles and aligned with Core Principles like transparency and resource justice, it helps communities identify bias, privacy risks, and environmental impacts while ensuring AI systems serve rather than harm community interests. Regular audits using this checklist promote continual improvement and accountability across the framework's Ethical AI Models component.

## Overview
The Ethical AI Audit Checklist provides a structured framework for evaluating AI systems within the Digital Commons Framework, ensuring they align with community values, ethical principles, and human rights. This tool addresses a critical need as AI systems increasingly affect decision-making, resource allocation, and information access.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Evaluates all aspects of AI ethics without requiring deep technical expertise
- **Accessibility**: Usable by communities with varying levels of resources and technical knowledge
- **Adaptability**: Customizable to different cultural contexts and specific applications
- **Actionable Results**: Produces clear findings that guide improvements or governance decisions

The checklist supports the framework's commitment to:
- **Ethical AI Models**: 95% compliance with ethical standards by 2030
- **Transparency**: Complete auditability of AI systems by 2032
- **Equity**: Fair outcomes across all demographic groups by 2035
- **Community Control**: Local governance of AI applications affecting communities

Regular audits using this checklist help prevent harmful outcomes like bias, privacy violations, and exploitation while ensuring AI systems serve rather than harm community interests.
