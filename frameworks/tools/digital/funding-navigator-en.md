# Funding Navigator: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This guide equips communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and advocates with strategies and tools to secure sustainable funding for the *Digital Commons Framework*, which governs digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons. Rooted in equitable commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s resource sharing) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 17), it outlines diverse funding streams, application processes, and budget management practices. Designed for low-resource settings, it ensures accessibility with minimal technical requirements and prioritizes marginalized communities, aiming for 80% node funding and 50% non-corporate revenue by 2035.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* enables communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized, transparent systems. Sustainable funding is critical to scale Local Citizen Nodes, develop infrastructure, and ensure inclusivity. This navigator provides practical tools—templates, pitch guides, and tracking systems—to access diverse funding sources, from crowdfunding to automation taxes. It supports communities with limited resources, using accessible methods like SMS or paper-based applications, and aims for:

- **Node Funding**: 80% of nodes fully funded by 2035.
- **Non-Corporate Revenue**: 50% of funding from non-corporate sources by 2035.
- **Equity**: Prioritize funding for marginalized groups (e.g., Indigenous, rural).
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable budgets via blockchain by 2030.

**Funding Goals**:
- Support node operations, governance, and digital resource access.
- Enable pilots (e.g., mesh networks, cultural archives).
- Foster economic resilience through data dividends and local innovation.
- Align with sustainability (80% renewable energy by 2035).

**Policy Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Complements national digital inclusion and economic development strategies.

## Why Funding Matters
Funding ensures the framework’s scalability and impact, addressing key challenges:

- **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack digital access; funding supports inclusive tools like SMS voting or mesh networks.
- **Corporate Dominance**: 5 firms control 72% of cloud infrastructure; non-corporate funding reduces reliance.
- **Resource Constraints**: 60% of communities lack funds for digital projects; diverse streams bridge gaps.
- **Environmental Impact**: Digital systems emit 5% of emissions; funding prioritizes renewable energy.

**Benefits**:
- **Equity**: Funds prioritize underserved communities, ensuring 90% global access by 2035.
- **Sustainability**: Diversified streams reduce dependency on single sources.
- **Community Empowerment**: Local control over budgets fosters trust and participation.
- **Global Scalability**: Funding supports 5,000 nodes and 50% adult engagement by 2035.

   - Community-driven campaigns via platforms or SMS (text DONATE to 12345).
   - Target: $50M globally by 2027.
   - Example: Senegal’s node raised $20,000 for a health data pilot.
   - Accessibility: Supports low-resource communities with offline pledges.
2. **Automation Taxes**:
   - 2% tax on AI/automation profits, collected by participating governments.
   - Target: $500M annually by 2032.
   - Example: Brazil’s node received $100,000 for mesh networks.
   - Benefit: Redistributes tech wealth equitably.
3. **Grants and NGOs**:
   - Philanthropic and multilateral grants (e.g., UNESCO, Gates Foundation).
   - Target: $100M by 2030.
   - Example: Canada’s Indigenous node secured $50,000 for cultural archives.
   - Accessibility: Simplified applications for small communities.
4. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)**:
   - Ethical collaborations with tech firms or local businesses.
   - Target: $300M by 2032.
   - Example: India’s node partnered with a tech firm for mobility data tools.
   - Oversight: Contracts audited for ethical compliance (95% by 2035).
5. **Data Dividends**:
   - Revenue from anonymized data usage, shared with communities.
   - Target: $200M annually by 2035.
   - Example: Rwanda’s node earned $10,000 from climate data dividends.
   - Benefit: Empowers communities with direct economic returns.

**Allocation**:
- 40% infrastructure (e.g., mesh networks), 30% governance (e.g., voting systems), 20% components (e.g., apps), 10% incentives (e.g., training).
- Nodes propose budgets (66% approval); Hubs ensure equitable distribution.
- Contingency funds (10% of budgets) for crises (e.g., hardware damage).

**Metrics**: 80% nodes funded, 50% non-corporate funding, 95% audit compliance by 2035.

## Application Process
A streamlined process ensures communities can access funding with minimal barriers.

1. **Identify Needs (1 week)**:
   - Node members discuss priorities (e.g., health data access, cultural archives).
   - Use Funding Needs Template (Appendix Q) to outline goals and costs.
   - Example: Kenya’s node prioritized solar-powered tablets.
2. **Choose Funding Stream (1 week)**:
   - Select crowdfunding, grants, or PPPs based on node capacity.
   - Consult Regional Hub for guidance (text FUND to 12345).
   - Example: Brazil chose crowdfunding for a youth-led app.
3. **Submit Proposal (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Complete Funding Proposal Template (Appendix R): Goals, budget, timeline.
   - Submit via SMS, email (globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com), or paper to Hub.
   - Example: Canada’s node submitted a grant proposal for $50,000.
4. **Review and Approval (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Hubs review proposals, prioritizing equity (e.g., Indigenous, rural nodes).
   - Approval requires 66% Hub consensus; feedback provided within 14 days.
   - Example: Senegal’s proposal was approved in 3 weeks with minor revisions.
