## Rural Context Assessment
Begin by understanding your community's specific characteristics and needs:

### 1. Connectivity Assessment
**Conduct a simple survey of existing connectivity**:

| Factor | Assessment Questions | Documentation Method |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Mobile coverage | Where is signal available? Which carriers? 2G/3G/4G? | Signal map on paper/local map |
| Internet access | Any fixed connections? Satellite? Cybercaf√©? | List access points and speeds |
| Device ownership | % with basic phones? Smartphones? Computers? | Simple household survey |
| Electricity | Grid coverage? Hours available? Alternative power? | Power availability calendar |
| Geographical barriers | Mountains? Rivers? Seasonal access issues? | Seasonal accessibility map |

**Documentation Tool**: Download the Rural Connectivity Assessment Form from globalgovernanceframework.org/rural-toolkit/assessment

### 2. Community Resources Inventory
**Map existing assets that can support digital commons**:

- **Physical Spaces**: Schools, community centers, religious buildings, markets
- **Technical Skills**: Individuals with relevant experience (teachers, youth, returned migrants)
- **Communication Systems**: Existing information flows (radio, notice boards, gathering places)
- **Organizational Structures**: Cooperatives, women's groups, youth associations
- **External Connections**: NGO partnerships, government programs, diaspora links

**Examples of Hidden Assets**: In rural Kenya, a school computer lab became the node hub; in Bangladesh, returning overseas workers brought technical skills; in Brazil, the church bulletin board became the official node information center.

### 3. Governance Context
**Document existing decision-making processes**:

- **Traditional Leadership**: How are community decisions currently made?
- **Meeting Patterns**: When and where do people gather? Who typically participates?
- **Trust Structures**: Who certifies or validates important information?
- **Excluded Groups**: Who is typically left out of decision processes?
- **Successful Precedents**: Previous community projects that worked well

**Documentation Tool**: Use the Governance Mapping Canvas (available in PDF) to visualize current processes.

### 4. Rural Implementation Pathway Selection
Based on your assessment, select the most appropriate pathway:

- **Path A (Minimal Tech)**: For areas with very limited connectivity, electricity, and devices
- **Path B (Basic Connectivity)**: For areas with intermittent connectivity and basic devices
- **Path C (Growing Digital)**: For areas transitioning to better connectivity with some shared devices
