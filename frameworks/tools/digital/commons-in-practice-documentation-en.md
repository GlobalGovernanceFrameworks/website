## Documentation Guidelines

### When to Document

- **Initial Implementation**: Create a first version after 3-6 months of operation
- **Major Milestones**: Update after significant achievements or changes
- **Annual Updates**: Provide at least yearly revisions to track progress
- **Upon Innovation**: Document whenever significant new approaches are developed
- **Case Closure**: Create a final version if the node ceases operation

### Documentation Quality

For maximum usefulness to the commons community, aim for:

- **Specificity**: Include concrete details rather than general statements
- **Honesty**: Document failures and challenges as thoroughly as successes
- **Accessibility**: Write in clear language accessible to non-specialists
- **Balance**: Give appropriate attention to both social and technical aspects
- **Evidence**: Support claims with data, examples, and documentation
- **Context**: Provide enough background for others to understand your situation
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize actionable insights over theoretical observations

### Sharing Your Documentation

1. Submit to your Regional Digital Hub for inclusion in the Knowledge Commons
2. Share directly with other nodes in your region or with similar focus areas
3. Present at Digital Commons gatherings, virtual or in-person
4. Contribute to the Field-Test Logbook Repository on the framework's collaborative platform
5. Discuss and refine through the Digital Commons Forum

## Example: Excerpt from Senegal Health Data Commons Documentation

> **Node Identifier**: SN-027-Thiès
> 
> **Location**: Thiès Region, Senegal, West Africa
> 
> **Time Period**: March 2026 - Present (documentation as of November 2027)
> 
> **Community Type**: Rural village cluster, 7 villages, approximately 3,000 residents total
> 
> **Digital Context**: Limited connectivity (2G mobile coverage), 60% mobile phone ownership, 15% smartphone ownership, 30% text literacy rate
> 
> **Implementation Path**: Path A (Minimal-Viable Node) with selected Path B elements
> 
> **Primary Focus Areas**: Open Data Commons (health data), Knowledge Commons (health education)
> 
> **Key Stakeholders**: 
> - Village health workers (5)
> - Traditional healers (3)
> - Youth technology champions (4)
> - Local government health office
> - Regional hospital
> - NGO partner: Digital Health Access Initiative
> 
> *[Excerpt from Governance Implementation section]*
> 
> **Participation Mechanisms**: The node faced significant challenges with digital participation due to low connectivity and text literacy. We developed a hybrid approach:
> 
> - **SMS Voting**: For text-literate members, we implemented a simplified SMS voting system that uses numeric codes rather than text (1=yes, 2=no, 3=abstain). Example: "VOTE 27-05 1" to approve proposal 05. This system includes verification through a community-verified phone number registry.
> 
> - **Voice Message System**: For members uncomfortable with text, we established a WhatsApp voice message group where proposals are explained verbally, and members can respond with voice votes. Youth technology champions transcribe these for the record.
> 
> - **Physical Voting Stations**: During weekly markets, we set up voting stations where community members can vote on current proposals using a simple paper system with village-specific validation stamps.
> 
> - **Community Radio**: Major proposals are announced via community radio, with call-in sessions for discussion.
> 
> **Cultural Adaptations**: Traditional decision-making in our region typically involves extended family heads meeting to build consensus. We adapted this by:
> 
> - Appointing family representatives to a "Digital Health Council" that meets monthly
> - Integrating traditional healers into the data classification process
> - Using existing trust networks for verification rather than technical mechanisms
> - Establishing a ceremony for "opening the data season" each year, led by village elders
> 
> **Metrics**: After 18 months of operation, we achieved:
> - 65% of adults participating in at least one vote
> - 80% of decisions achieving super-majority consensus (>75% approval)
> - 15-20 day average for decision completion (proposal to implementation)
