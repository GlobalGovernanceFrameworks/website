## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

**"People seem skeptical about technology"**
- Start with education about corporate surveillance and digital rights
- Focus on concrete local problems technology could solve
- Emphasize community control and cultural values

**"We don't have technical expertise"**
- Begin with low-tech options like SMS voting or security workshops
- Connect with regional technical support networks
- Build skills gradually through peer learning

**"Our community is too busy/divided"**
- Start small with just a few committed people
- Focus on specific, tangible benefits
- Use existing meetings and gatherings rather than creating new ones

**"We don't have funding"**
- Many effective projects require minimal financial resources
- Explore community crowdfunding, grant opportunities, and volunteer labor
- Focus on projects that save money (like community broadband)

**"Local government seems opposed"**
- Start with projects that don't require government approval
- Build community support first, then engage officials
- Focus on public benefits like digital inclusion and economic development
