# Resource Mapping Tool: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 8 minutes

**Purpose**: This tool enables communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and advocates to identify, organize, and leverage resources—human, financial, technical, and cultural—for implementing the *Digital Commons Framework*, which governs digital resources (data, software, knowledge, infrastructure) as shared global commons. Rooted in collaborative commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s resource-sharing models) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 17), it provides a structured template and process for mapping assets, prioritizing needs, and planning projects. Designed for low-resource settings, it supports accessibility with oral, paper, or SMS-based methods, targeting 80% node resource utilization and 90% equitable access by 2035.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* empowers communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized systems. Resource mapping identifies local assets—skills, funds, tools, and knowledge—to support node setup, governance, and projects like mesh networks or cultural archives. This tool provides a customizable template and process, requiring minimal technical skills and ensuring inclusivity for marginalized groups (e.g., Indigenous, rural). It aims for:

- **Resource Utilization**: 80% of nodes leveraging local assets by 2035.
- **Equity**: 90% global access to digital resources by 2035.
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable resource maps via blockchain by 2030.
- **Sustainability**: 80% renewable energy for infrastructure by 2035.

**Tool Goals**:
- Identify and prioritize community resources for digital commons projects.
- Foster collaboration within and across nodes.
- Reduce dependency on external funding.
- Align with community priorities and SDG objectives.

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports community empowerment and digital inclusion strategies.

## Why Resource Mapping Matters
Resource mapping addresses barriers and unlocks opportunities:

- **Resource Scarcity**: 60% of communities lack startup funds or tools; mapping reveals local assets.
- **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack digital access; local resources (e.g., volunteers, hardware) bridge gaps.
- **Corporate Reliance**: 5 firms control 72% of cloud infrastructure; community assets reduce dependency.
- **Cultural Loss**: 50% of Indigenous languages risk extinction; mapping preserves knowledge.

**Benefits**:
- **Autonomy**: Communities leverage local strengths for self-sufficiency.
- **Inclusivity**: Engages diverse groups (e.g., youth, elders) in resource identification.
- **Efficiency**: Prioritizes assets for maximum impact.
- **Scalability**: Supports 5,000 nodes and 50% adult participation by 2035.

## Resource Categories
The tool organizes resources into four key categories, tailored to the framework’s needs.

1. **Human Resources**:
   - Skills: Technical (e.g., coding), governance (e.g., facilitation), cultural (e.g., storytelling).
   - Volunteers: Community members, youth, elders.
   - Example: Brazil’s node identified 10 volunteers with app development skills.
2. **Financial Resources**:
   - Cash: Donations, crowdfunding, data dividends.
   - In-kind: Free venues, donated hardware.
   - Example: Senegal’s node secured $5,000 from local pledges.
3. **Technical Resources**:
   - Hardware: Tablets, solar panels, servers.
   - Software: Open-source tools, apps.
   - Infrastructure: Mesh networks, cloud access.
   - Example: Rwanda’s node used donated phones for SMS voting.
4. **Cultural Resources**:
   - Knowledge: Indigenous stories, local expertise.
   - Archives: Songs, art, oral histories.
   - Example: Canada’s node mapped 450 Cree narratives for archiving.

**Prioritization**:
- Focus on equitable access (e.g., prioritize rural, Indigenous needs).
- Align with node goals (e.g., health data, education tools).
- Ensure sustainability (e.g., renewable energy for tech).

#### 3. Technical Resources
| Resource | Description | Quantity | Owner/Source | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------|----------|

## Mapping Process
A participatory process ensures comprehensive and inclusive resource mapping.

1. **Convene Community (1 day)**:
   - Gather diverse members (e.g., youth, elders, women) for a mapping workshop.
   - Use oral storytelling, flipcharts, or SMS polls for input.
   - Example: Senegal’s node held a village meeting to list skills.
2. **Identify Resources (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Brainstorm assets using Resource Mapping Template (Appendix GG).
   - Categorize into human, financial, technical, cultural.
   - Example: Brazil identified 10 coders and $5,000 in pledges.
3. **Assess Needs (1 week)**:
   - List gaps (e.g., funding, hardware) aligned with node goals.
   - Prioritize based on equity and impact.
   - Example: Canada prioritized cultural archive funding.
4. **Prioritize and Plan (1 week)**:
   - Vote on priorities (66% majority, 50% quorum).
   - Develop action plan for resource use (e.g., crowdfunding, training).
   - Example: Rwanda planned a mesh network pilot with donated phones.
5. **Document and Share (1 week)**:
   - Record map in Field-Test Logbook (Appendix F) or blockchain ledger.
   - Share with Regional Hub and globalgovernanceframework.org.
   - Example: India’s map guided a mobility data project.

**Accessibility**:
- Oral mapping for non-literate members.
- Multilingual templates (50 languages by 2030).

## Utilizing Resources
Mapped resources are leveraged to support node activities and projects.

- **Node Setup**:
  - Use volunteers for governance, donated hardware for voting systems.
  - Example: Kenya used elder facilitators for node meetings.
- **Project Implementation**:
  - Apply funds or skills to pilots (e.g., health apps, cultural archives).
  - Example: Brazil’s coders built a farming app with crowdfunding.
- **Community Empowerment**:
  - Train members using local expertise (e.g., tech workshops).
  - Example: Canada trained youth to archive narratives.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Share resources with other nodes via Regional Hubs.
  - Example: Rwanda shared mesh network expertise with 3 nodes.

**Prioritization**:
- Focus on high-impact, equitable projects (e.g., rural access).
- Ensure cultural sensitivity for Indigenous resources.
- Align with sustainability (e.g., solar-powered tech).

**Metrics**: 80% resource utilization, 50% inter-node sharing by 2035.
