# Sample Audit Report Template: Digital Commons Framework

**Purpose**: This template provides a standardized format for communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and Regional Hubs within the *Digital Commons Framework* to conduct and document audits of governance, resource management, and digital tool usage (e.g., data, software, infrastructure) to ensure ethical compliance, transparency, and equity. Rooted in transparent commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s accountability mechanisms) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 10, 16, 17), it is designed for accessibility in low-resource settings, supporting paper-based, SMS, or digital formats. It aims for 95% audit compliance across nodes by 2035, fostering trust and accountability in managing shared digital commons.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* enables communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized, transparent systems. The *Sample Audit Report Template* ensures nodes adhere to ethical standards (e.g., privacy, fairness, sustainability) by documenting audits of governance decisions, budgets, data usage, and tool operations. Accessible to all skill levels, it supports low-literacy users with oral or paper-based methods and aims for:

- **Compliance**: 95% audit compliance across nodes by 2035.
- **Transparency**: 100% auditable reports via blockchain by 2030.
- **Equity**: Prioritize marginalized communities (e.g., Indigenous, rural).
- **Inclusivity**: Support 50 languages and Indigenous protocols by 2030.

**Template Goals**:
- Standardize audit reporting for consistency and accountability.
- Identify and address ethical or operational issues.
- Engage communities in transparent governance.
- Align with sustainability (80% renewable energy by 2035).

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Strong Institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports digital sovereignty, ethical AI, and community trust.

## Audit Objectives
Audits within the framework aim to:

1. **Ensure Ethical Compliance**:
   - Verify adherence to privacy, fairness, and sustainability standards.
   - Example: Confirm health data is anonymized per node protocols.
2. **Promote Transparency**:
   - Document decisions, budgets, and data usage on blockchain.
   - Example: Track $10,000 budget allocation for public access.
3. **Detect and Mitigate Issues**:
   - Identify biases, privacy breaches, or inefficiencies (99.8% accuracy by 2030).
   - Example: Flag biased AI model for retraining.
4. **Engage Community**:
   - Involve diverse members (e.g., youth, elders) in audit process.
   - Example: Collect feedback via SMS for inclusivity.
5. **Support Continuous Improvement**:
   - Recommend actions to enhance governance and operations.
   - Example: Suggest training for better data management.

## Audit Process
A participatory process ensures thorough and inclusive audits.

1. **Plan Audit (1 week)**:
   - Define scope (e.g., budget, data usage) using Ethics Audit Template (Appendix H).
   - Assemble diverse audit team (e.g., elders, youth, facilitators).
   - Example: Senegal planned a health data audit with 5 auditors.
2. **Collect Data (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Review blockchain logs, tool analytics, and node records.
   - Gather feedback via SMS, interviews, or paper surveys.
   - Example: Brazil collected 100 SMS responses on governance compliance.
3. **Analyze Findings (1 week)**:
   - Use automated tools (e.g., bias scanners) and manual checks.
   - Identify compliance, issues, and strengths.
   - Example: Canada detected 1% bias in AI cultural archive tool.
4. **Draft Report (1 week)**:
   - Complete template, summarizing findings and recommendations.
   - Translate into local languages or audio for accessibility.
