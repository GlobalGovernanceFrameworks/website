# Public-Private Partnership Template: Digital Commons Framework

**Purpose**: This template guides communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and Regional Hubs in establishing ethical and equitable Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund and support the *Digital Commons Framework*, which governs digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons. Rooted in transparent commons governance (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s collaborative models) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 17), it ensures partnerships prioritize community benefit, data sovereignty, and sustainability. Designed for accessibility, it supports low-resource settings with clear steps and adaptable formats, targeting $300M in PPP funding by 2032 and 95% ethical compliance by 2035.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* enables communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized systems. PPPs leverage private sector resources (e.g., tech firms, local businesses) and public/community expertise to fund infrastructure, develop tools, and scale nodes, while ensuring ethical alignment. This template provides a structured agreement and process to establish PPPs, requiring minimal technical expertise and supporting inclusive participation. It aims for:

- **Funding**: $300M from PPPs by 2032.
- **Equity**: Prioritize marginalized communities (e.g., Indigenous, rural).
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable agreements via blockchain by 2030.
- **Sustainability**: 80% renewable energy for PPP-funded infrastructure by 2035.

**PPP Goals**:
- Fund node operations, pilots, and resource access.
- Ensure community control over data and outcomes.
- Align with ethical standards and SDG priorities.
- Foster innovation while preventing corporate dominance.

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports digital sovereignty and inclusion policies.

## Partnership Objectives
PPPs within the framework aim to:

1. **Resource Mobilization**:
   - Secure funding, expertise, or infrastructure (e.g., cloud servers, mesh networks).
   - Example: Tech firm provides $50,000 for node’s data platform.
2. **Community Empowerment**:
   - Prioritize local needs (e.g., health data, cultural archives).
   - Ensure 100% community consent for data use.
   - Example: Node controls health app developed by private partner.
3. **Ethical Innovation**:
   - Develop open-source tools or AI with bias-free, transparent design.
   - Target 99.8% ethical compliance by 2030.
   - Example: AI firm co-develops audited crop prediction tool.
4. **Sustainability**:
   - Use renewable energy and minimize e-waste in PPP projects.
   - Target 80% renewable energy by 2035.
   - Example: Solar-powered servers funded by PPP.
5. **Scalability**:
   - Support node growth (5,000 nodes by 2035) and global collaboration.
   - Example: PPP funds regional mesh network for 10 nodes.

## Key Components
A successful PPP includes:

- **Community Leadership**:
  - Nodes define priorities and retain decision-making authority (66% majority vote, 50% quorum).
  - Example: Senegal’s node set health data access rules.
- **Private Partner Role**:
  - Provide funding, technology, or expertise under community oversight.
  - Example: Tech firm supplies cloud storage with node-defined terms.
- **Ethical Safeguards**:
  - Contracts audited for privacy, fairness, and sustainability (95% compliance by 2035).
  - Example: AI tool audited for cultural bias before deployment.
- **Transparency**:
  - Agreements and budgets tracked via blockchain ledger (globalgovernanceframework.org).
  - Example: Brazil’s PPP budget publicly accessible.
- **Mutual Benefit**:
  - Communities gain resources; partners gain social impact and market goodwill.
  - Example: Firm’s logo on node’s app promotes ethical branding.
