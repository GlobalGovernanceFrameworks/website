# Digital Commons Health Dashboard Documentation: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This documentation describes the *Digital Commons Health Dashboard*, a digital tool designed to empower communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and stakeholders within the *Digital Commons Framework* to access, analyze, and govern anonymized health data as a shared global commons. Rooted in equitable commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s community-driven resource management) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 3, 10, 17), the dashboard ensures data sovereignty, privacy, and accessibility in low-resource settings through offline capabilities, multilingual interfaces, and inclusive formats (e.g., SMS, audio). It aims to enable 80% of nodes to leverage health data for community well-being by 2035, fostering equitable and sustainable health outcomes.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* enables communities to govern digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—equitably through decentralized systems. The *Digital Commons Health Dashboard* is an open-source tool that provides communities with secure access to anonymized health data (e.g., disease outbreaks, vaccination rates), analytics, and governance tools to inform local health priorities. Designed for inclusivity, it supports low-literacy users, offline access, and 50 languages by 2030. It aims for:

- **Health Impact**: 80% of nodes using health data for community benefit by 2035.
- **Equity**: 90% global access to health data tools by 2035.
- **Privacy**: 99.9% data integrity and sovereignty compliance by 2030.
- **Cultural Inclusion**: Support for Indigenous health protocols and 100 languages by 2035.

**Dashboard Goals**:
- Enable data-driven health decisions (e.g., outbreak response, resource allocation).
- Ensure community control over health data usage.
- Provide accessible analytics for diverse users.
- Align with sustainability (80% renewable energy for infrastructure by 2035).

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports digital inclusion, data sovereignty, and public health initiatives.
