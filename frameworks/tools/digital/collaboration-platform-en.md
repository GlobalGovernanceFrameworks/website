# Real-Time Collaboration Platform Documentation: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This documentation describes the *Real-Time Collaboration Platform*, a digital tool designed to enable communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and stakeholders within the *Digital Commons Framework* to collaborate seamlessly on governance, projects, and resource management for shared digital resources (data, software, knowledge, infrastructure). Rooted in participatory commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s consensus-driven councils) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 17), the platform ensures accessibility in low-resource settings through offline capabilities, multilingual support, and inclusive formats (e.g., SMS, audio). It aims to connect 80% of nodes for collaborative governance by 2035, fostering equitable, transparent, and sustainable digital systems.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* empowers communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized, transparent systems. The *Real-Time Collaboration Platform* is an open-source tool that facilitates synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, enabling nodes to coordinate governance (e.g., policy votes), share resources (e.g., project plans), and engage globally. Designed for inclusivity, it supports low-literacy users, offline access, and 50 languages by 2030. It aims for:

- **Collaboration**: 80% of nodes connected for collaborative governance by 2035.
- **Equity**: 90% global access to collaboration tools by 2035.
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable interactions via blockchain by 2030.
- **Cultural Inclusion**: Support for Indigenous protocols and 100 languages by 2035.

**Platform Goals**:
- Enable real-time and asynchronous collaboration across nodes.
- Support inclusive governance and project coordination.
- Ensure data sovereignty and ethical collaboration.
- Foster global connectivity for shared digital commons.

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports digital inclusion, community empowerment, and global cooperation.
