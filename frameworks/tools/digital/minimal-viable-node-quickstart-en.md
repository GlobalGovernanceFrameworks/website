Appendix F: Minimal-Viable Node Quickstart provides a concise, one-page guide for communities to launch a Local Citizen Node with minimal resources, focusing on essential actions and tools. Designed for accessibility in rural or disconnected areas, it follows in the tradition of historical commons practices that emphasized simple, universally understandable rules. From the Iroquois Confederacy's council formation protocols to Elinor Ostrom's principles of clear boundaries and collective choice, this guide distills the framework's Core Principles and Governance Structure into actionable steps. Unlike the comprehensive Appendix A: Pilot Onboarding, this quickstart targets immediate implementation with minimal infrastructure. With icon-based instructions and SMS options, it enables diverse stakeholders like Aisha in Senegal or Fatima in Bangladesh to begin governing digital resources within their communities, connecting them to the broader commons ecosystem. The next section, Appendix G: Field-Test Logbook Template, provides tools for documenting implementation experiences.

### <a id="what-is-a-node"></a>What is a Node? [üì±]
A Local Citizen Node is a community group that governs digital resources (data, software, infrastructure) and proposes policies for the Digital Commons. It's the foundation of the framework, connecting your community to regional and global governance. Unlike complex technical systems, a node can begin with just people and basic communication tools. Even communities with minimal internet access can form effective nodes through simple means like SMS or paper-based processes.

**Example**: In rural Senegal, Aisha's community meets weekly under a baobab tree, using a feature phone to record decisions via SMS.

### <a id="how-to-start"></a>How to Start [ü§ù]
1. **Gather 10+ Community Members**:
   - Invite diverse participants (youth, elders, women, technical/non-technical)
   - Host an initial meeting explaining the Digital Commons
   - Record names and contact details
   
2. **Choose a Facilitator**:
   - Select someone trusted by the community
   - The facilitator coordinates meetings and records decisions
   - Rotate this role every 3-6 months if possible

3. **Register Your Node**:
   - Text "NEW NODE" to 12345 with location and facilitator name, or
   - Use paper form and mail to nearest Regional Digital Hub, or
   - Visit globalgovernanceframework.org/join (if internet available)

**Example**: In Bangladesh, Fatima gathered 15 villagers including farmers, a teacher, students, and elders, and registered their node via SMS.

### <a id="how-to-propose"></a>How to Propose [üí°]
1. **Discuss Community Needs**:
   - Meet regularly to identify digital priorities (e.g., health data access, educational resources)
   - Focus on practical benefits for your community
   
2. **Write a Simple Proposal**:
   - State what you want to achieve in 1-3 sentences
   - Explain why it matters to your community
   - Note resources needed (e.g., training, funding, connections)
   
3. **Submit to Your Node**:
   - Share at community meeting, or
   - Text proposal to facilitator, or
   - Submit paper form to facilitator

**Example**: Carlos in Brazil proposed: "Our community needs access to weather data for farming. We request mobile alerts for severe weather and seasonal forecasts."

### <a id="how-to-vote"></a>How to Vote [‚úì]
1. **Review Proposals**:
   - Facilitator presents proposals to the community
   - Allow time for questions and discussion
   - Make sure everyone understands before voting
   
2. **Cast Your Vote**:
   - By SMS: Text "VOTE" + "YES/NO" + "Proposal ID" to 12345, or
   - By Paper: Mark ballot and submit to facilitator, or
   - By Hand: Raise hand or use another agreed physical method
   
3. **Verify Results**:
   - Two community witnesses count votes
   - Facilitator announces results
   - Majority wins (66% needed to pass)
   - At least half of node members must participate

**Example**: A Rwanda node voted on educational resources using paper ballots, with school principal and elder as witnesses.

### <a id="how-to-escalate"></a>How to Escalate [‚¨ÜÔ∏è]
If your node needs support or disagrees with a decision:

1. **Contact Regional Hub**:
   - Text "HELP" + brief issue to 12345, or
   - Call Regional Hub hotline, or
   - Submit paper form via mail

2. **Join Regional Calls**:
   - Monthly call-in sessions available via basic phone
   - Share your node's experience and challenges
   - Learn from other nodes

3. **Request Mediation**:
   - For disputes within the node or with other nodes
   - Regional Hub will provide neutral facilitator
   - Decision reached within 14 days

**Example**: When Lila's Canada node needed support for Indigenous protocols, they texted their Regional Hub and received guidance within 48 hours.

### <a id="tools-needed"></a>Tools Needed [üîß]
Minimal requirements to start:

- **Notebook and Pen**: To record proposals, votes, and decisions
- **Basic Phone**: For SMS voting and Regional Hub contact
- **Optional**: Solar charger for phone, printed copy of Digital Commons Charter

More advanced but still accessible tools:

- **Solar-Powered Mesh Hub**: Low-cost device to create local network
- **USB Drive**: For offline sharing of Knowledge Commons resources
- **Feature Phone with SMS**: For node coordination and voting

**Example**: Mei's Singapore node started with paper records before adding a small solar hub that provides offline access to educational resources.

### <a id="ultra-lightweight-digital-implementation"></a>Ultra-Lightweight Digital Implementation [üíª]
For individuals or communities with basic technical capabilities, here is an extremely accessible way to establish your digital commons presence using existing free tools and minimal resources.

**Requirements**:
- Mobile phone with data subscription or regular internet access
- Basic computer or laptop (can be shared)
- Approximately $15 USD per year for domain registration
- Basic familiarity with web browsing and online accounts

**Step-by-Step Implementation**:
1. **Create a GitHub Account**:
   - Visit github.com and sign up for a free account (might require an email account)
   - This provides free version control and web hosting
   
2. **Create Your Digital Commons Repository**:
   - Click "New repository" and name it for your node
   - Select "Add a README file" and make it public
   - This becomes your node's central coordination point

3. **Use AI Assistants for Content Creation**:
   - Utilize free AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek) to help draft:
     * Node charter and governance rules
     * Documentation of community needs
     * Meeting notes and decisions
     * Educational resources
   - These tools can help overcome technical barriers

4. **Document Using Markdown**:
   - Learn basic markdown (simple formatting symbols)
   - Create files like meeting-notes.md, proposals.md, decisions.md
   - Markdown requires minimal technical knowledge but creates professional-looking documents

5. **Establish Public Web Presence**:
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Register a domain name (~$15/year) if desired
   - Connect domain to GitHub Pages (instructions provided by GitHub or AI)

6. **Build Community Engagement**:
   - Use GitHub Issues for proposals and community feedback
   - Create a simple form using Google Forms or similar tools for community input
   - Document decision outcomes transparently in your repository

**Real-World Example**: The approach has been successfully implemented for educational commons like spiralize.org, an open educational resource on Spiral Dynamics, and even this very framework at globalgovernanceframework.org. These projects demonstrate how lightweight tools can create robust digital commons with minimal resources.

**Advantages**:
- No technical programming knowledge required
- Zero hosting costs (only optional domain registration)
- Automatic version history of all changes
- Accessible from any connected device
- Expandable as your technical capacity grows

**Support Resources**:
- Basic GitHub tutorial: globalgovernanceframework.org/github-quickstart
- Simple markdown guide: globalgovernanceframework.org/markdown-basics
- AI assistance guide: globalgovernanceframework.org/ai-tools-for-commons

**Next Steps**: Once your node is active, request the Field-Test Logbook (Appendix G) to track your progress. Download at globalgovernanceframework.org/tools/digital.

**Contact**: Email globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com
