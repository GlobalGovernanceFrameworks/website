# Community Funding Guide: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This guide empowers communities and Local Citizen Nodes to secure and manage funding for the *Digital Commons Framework*, which governs digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons. Rooted in equitable commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s resource-sharing models) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 17), it provides practical strategies for community-driven funding, including crowdfunding and data dividends. Designed for low-resource settings, it ensures accessibility with tools like SMS and paper-based processes, targeting 80% node funding and 50% non-corporate revenue by 2035.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* enables communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized, transparent systems. Community funding—driven by local contributions, crowdfunding, and data dividends—ensures nodes can operate, access resources, and launch pilots without relying solely on external sources. This guide offers step-by-step instructions for raising and managing funds, requiring minimal technical skills and supporting inclusive participation. It aims for:

- **Node Funding**: 80% of nodes fully funded by 2035.
- **Non-Corporate Revenue**: 50% from community-driven sources by 2035.
- **Equity**: Prioritize marginalized groups (e.g., Indigenous, rural).
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable budgets via blockchain by 2030.

**Funding Goals**:
- Support node setup, governance, and digital projects (e.g., mesh networks, cultural archives).
- Empower communities to control their financial future.
- Foster resilience and local innovation.
- Align with sustainability (80% renewable energy by 2035).

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Complements community empowerment and digital inclusion initiatives.

## Why Community Funding Matters
Community funding drives autonomy and addresses key challenges:

- **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack digital access; community funds support inclusive tools like SMS voting.
- **Corporate Control**: 5 firms dominate 72% of cloud infrastructure; local funding reduces reliance.
- **Resource Gaps**: 60% of communities lack startup funds; crowdfunding bridges this.
- **Economic Exclusion**: Marginalized groups often lack access to traditional funding; community models prioritize equity.

**Benefits**:
- **Autonomy**: Communities control budgets, aligning with local priorities.
- **Inclusivity**: Low-cost methods (e.g., pledges, SMS) engage all members.
- **Resilience**: Diversified funds ensure stability during crises.
- **Scalability**: Supports 5,000 nodes and 50% adult participation by 2035.

## Funding Sources
Community-driven funding comes from accessible, equitable sources, managed by nodes with Regional Hub support.

1. **Crowdfunding Campaigns**:
   - Local and global campaigns via platforms or in-person pledges.
   - Target: $50M globally by 2027.
   - Example: Senegal’s node raised $10,000 for health data access.
   - Accessibility: Offline pledges for low-resource communities.
2. **Data Dividends**:
   - Revenue from anonymized data usage, shared with communities.
   - Target: $200M annually by 2035.
   - Example: Rwanda’s node earned $5,000 from climate data dividends.
   - Benefit: Direct economic returns for community priorities.
3. **Community Contributions**:
   - In-kind (e.g., volunteer time, hardware) or small cash donations.
   - Target: 30% of node budgets by 2030.
   - Example: Brazil’s node collected volunteer hours for app development.
   - Accessibility: Flexible for low-income members.
4. **Local Partnerships**:
   - Collaborations with cooperatives, schools, or small businesses.
   - Target: $20M by 2030.
   - Example: India’s node partnered with a cooperative for $8,000.
   - Benefit: Strengthens local economies.

**Allocation**:
- 40% infrastructure (e.g., tablets, networks), 30% governance (e.g., voting systems), 20% projects (e.g., apps), 10% training.
- Nodes approve budgets (66% majority vote, 50% quorum).
- Contingency funds (10% of budgets) for emergencies (e.g., hardware repair).

**Metrics**: 80% nodes funded, 50% community-driven revenue, 95% audit compliance by 2035.

## Raising Funds
A clear process helps communities raise funds inclusively and effectively.

1. **Identify Priorities (1 week)**:
   - Discuss needs (e.g., mesh network, cultural archive) in node meetings.
   - Use Community Funding Needs Template (Appendix BB) to list goals and costs.
   - Example: Kenya’s node prioritized solar-powered tablets.
2. **Choose Funding Source (1 week)**:
   - Select crowdfunding, dividends, or partnerships based on capacity.
   - Consult Regional Hub.
   - Example: Brazil chose crowdfunding for a youth app.
3. **Plan Campaign (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Use Crowdfunding Campaign Template (Appendix CC): Set goal, timeline, outreach plan.
   - Promote via posters, SMS, or community events.
   - Example: Senegal’s node planned a $10,000 campaign with flyers.
4. **Launch Campaign (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Share via SMS, social media, or in-person events.
   - Engage youth, elders, and local leaders for broad support.
   - Example: Canada’s node raised $15,000 at a cultural festival.
5. **Collect and Track Funds (1 week)**:
   - Use mobile money, cash, or in-kind pledges.
   - Log contributions with Funding Tracker (Appendix DD).
   - Example: Rwanda tracked $5,000 in dividends via blockchain.

**Accessibility**:
- Oral pledges for non-literate members.
- Multilingual campaigns (50 languages by 2030).
- Hub mentors assist with planning.

**Metrics**: 80% campaigns successful, 90% equitable participation by 2035.

## Managing Funds
Transparent, community-led management ensures accountability and trust.

- **Budget Planning**:
  - Use Community Budget Planner (Appendix EE) to allocate funds (e.g., 40% infrastructure).
  - Approve via 66% majority vote.
  - Example: India’s node allocated $8,000 for mobility data tools.
- **Tracking Expenses**:
  - Log spending monthly with Funding Tracker (Appendix DD).
  - Use blockchain ledger for transparency (globalgovernanceframework.org).
  - Example: Brazil tracked $10,000 in crowdfunding funds.
- **Auditing**:
  - Conduct quarterly audits with Community Audit Template (Appendix FF).
