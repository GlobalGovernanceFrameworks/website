**Core Principle**: Decisions everyone can live with, even if not everyone's first choice

**Consensus Levels**:
1. **Full Support**: "I enthusiastically support this decision"
2. **Support with Concerns**: "I support this but have some concerns we should address"
3. **Stand Aside**: "I don't support this but won't block the group"
4. **Block**: "I cannot support this and believe it harms our community"

- **Timeline Clarification**: When does decision need to be made?

**Step 2: Clarifying Questions (10 minutes)**
- **Information Gathering**: Questions about facts and proposals
- **Understanding Check**: Ensure everyone understands the issue
- **No Advocacy**: Save opinions and arguments for later
- **Equal Participation**: Encourage questions from all community members

**Step 3: Discussion and Ideas (30 minutes)**
- **Round-Robin Sharing**: Everyone shares thoughts if they want
- **Idea Building**: Build on others' suggestions constructively
- **Concern Expression**: Share worries and potential problems
- **Creative Solutions**: Explore innovative approaches

**Step 4: Proposal Development (20 minutes)**
- **Synthesis**: Combine ideas into concrete proposals

**Step 5: Consensus Testing (15 minutes)**
