# Governance Simulator App Documentation: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This documentation describes the *Governance Simulator App*, a digital tool designed to empower communities, Local Citizen Nodes, and stakeholders within the *Digital Commons Framework* to simulate and practice decentralized governance processes for managing digital resources (data, software, knowledge, infrastructure) as shared global commons. Rooted in participatory commons principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s consensus models) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 10, 16, 17), the app supports low-resource settings with offline capabilities, multilingual interfaces, and accessible formats (e.g., SMS, audio). It aims to train 50% of node participants in governance by 2035, ensuring equitable, transparent, and inclusive decision-making.

## Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* enables communities to govern digital resources equitably through decentralized, transparent systems. The *Governance Simulator App* is an open-source tool that allows users to practice governance tasks—proposing policies, voting, and resolving disputes—in a simulated environment, building skills for real-world node operations. Designed for inclusivity, it supports low-literacy users, offline access, and 50 languages by 2030. It aims for:

- **Participation**: Train 50% of node participants by 2035.
- **Equity**: 90% global access to governance tools by 2035.
- **Transparency**: 95% auditable simulations via blockchain by 2030.
- **Cultural Inclusion**: Support Indigenous protocols and 100 languages by 2035.

**App Goals**:
- Build governance capacity for communities, youth, and Indigenous groups.
- Simulate realistic scenarios (e.g., data policy votes, AI ethics disputes).
- Ensure accessibility in low-resource settings.
- Foster trust in decentralized decision-making.

**Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Strong Institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports digital inclusion and participatory governance initiatives.
