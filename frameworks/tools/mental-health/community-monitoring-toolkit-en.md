## <a id="getting-started"></a>Getting Started with Community Monitoring

### Understanding Community-Led Monitoring

**Community-led monitoring puts communities in control of defining success, collecting information, and using findings for advocacy and improvement.**

Unlike traditional evaluation that measures what institutions think is important, community-led monitoring centers community wisdom about what healing and flourishing actually look like.

#### **Core Principles of Community Monitoring**
**Community Sovereignty**: Communities control the monitoring process, data, and how findings are used

**Storytelling as Evidence**: Personal and community stories are treated as valid and important evidence alongside numbers and statistics

**Cultural Responsiveness**: Monitoring approaches honor diverse cultural understandings of mental health and healing

**Action Orientation**: Monitoring is designed to support community action and advocacy rather than just collecting information

**Healing-Centered**: The monitoring process itself should support community healing and connection

### Community Readiness Assessment

#### **Readiness Checklist**
**Community Foundation**:
- [ ] Trusted community members willing to participate in monitoring
- [ ] Some existing mental health services or initiatives to monitor
- [ ] Community interest in improving mental health support
- [ ] Basic meeting space and communication methods available

**Cultural Readiness**:
- [ ] Understanding of cultural protocols for discussing mental health
- [ ] Respect for traditional healing approaches and knowledge
- [ ] Commitment to honoring diverse healing traditions
- [ ] Recognition of community expertise and lived experience

**Capacity Assessment**:
- [ ] Community members with time to participate in monitoring
- [ ] Basic literacy and communication skills in community
- [ ] Access to simple technology (phone, basic internet) if needed
- [ ] Connection to mental health advocates or allies

#### **Community Consultation Process**
**Before beginning monitoring, engage the community in consultation**:

**Community Meetings**: Hold open community meetings to discuss monitoring approach and get input on priorities

**Elder and Traditional Healer Consultation**: Seek guidance from elders and traditional healers about appropriate approaches

**Family and Support System Input**: Include families and support networks in planning monitoring approach

**Youth Engagement**: Ensure young people have voice in monitoring design and implementation

### Setting Up Your Monitoring Team

#### **Community Monitoring Circle Formation**

- **People with Lived Experience (40-50%)**: Individuals with personal mental health experience
- **Traditional Healers/Cultural Practitioners (20-25%)**: Community healing knowledge holders
- **Family Members/Support People (15-20%)**: People supporting others with mental health challenges
- **Community Organizers/Advocates (10-15%)**: People with organizing and advocacy experience

## <a id="narrative-equity"></a>Narrative Equity Review Process

### Understanding Narrative Equity

**Narrative equity means that communities control their own stories about mental health, healing, and transformation.**

Traditional evaluation often extracts stories from communities for institutional use. Narrative equity ensures communities maintain ownership and control over their stories.

#### **Community Storytelling Protocols**

**Healing Story Circles**:
```
Circle Setup:
- Comfortable, culturally appropriate space
- Opening ritual or ceremony as appropriate
- Talking piece or other cultural protocol for sharing
- Refreshments and child care as needed
- 2-3 hours with breaks

Circle Process:
1. Opening and grounding (15 minutes)
2. Story sharing rounds (60-90 minutes)
3. Reflection and meaning-making (30 minutes)
4. Action planning (15-30 minutes)
5. Closing and appreciation (15 minutes)

Story Sharing Guidelines:
- Share only what feels safe and comfortable
- Listen without giving advice or judgment
- Honor confidentiality and privacy
- Recognize all experiences as valid
- Focus on strengths and healing alongside challenges
```

**Elder-Youth Story Dialogues**:
```
Intergenerational Dialogue Format:
- Pair elders with young people for story sharing
- Focus on changes in mental health over time
- Explore traditional healing knowledge and practices
- Discuss contemporary mental health challenges
- Identify wisdom for community healing

Topics for Dialogue:
- How mental health understanding has changed

## Conclusion: Community Monitoring as Community Healing

Community-led monitoring represents a fundamental shift from surveillance to liberation, from institutional accountability to community empowerment. When communities control their own evaluation and advocacy, monitoring becomes a tool for healing and transformation rather than compliance and control.

This toolkit provides the foundation for communities to begin their own monitoring journey, but the most important resources are the wisdom, experience, and commitment that exist within every community. Traditional healing knowledge, community networks, and collective care are the true foundations of effective community monitoring.

The transformation of mental health systems requires communities to define success, document experiences, and advocate for change based on their own priorities and values. Through community-led monitoring, communities reclaim their power to shape mental health approaches that truly serve community healing and flourishing.

**Remember**: Community monitoring is not just about documenting what is wrong, but about documenting community strengths, cultural resources, and successful healing approaches. The goal is not just accountability, but community healing and empowerment.

**Your community's monitoring journey begins with the wisdom and resources you already have. Trust your community's knowledge, honor your cultural protocols, and remember that healing happens in community.**
