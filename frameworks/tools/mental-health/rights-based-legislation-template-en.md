# Rights-Based Legislation Template with Sunset Clauses
## Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health

> *"From coercion to care, from pathology to flourishing - law as liberation rather than control."*

## Overview

This legislative template provides a comprehensive framework for transforming mental health law from coercive institutional control to rights-based community care. The template includes systematic sunset clauses that eliminate coercive practices over a 5-year timeline while building community-based alternatives and ensuring human dignity throughout the transition.

**Remember: This legislation exists to serve community healing and liberation, not institutional mental health systems. Its authority comes from human dignity and community sovereignty, not professional expertise or institutional convenience. Draft with community wisdom, implement through community authority, and measure success through community-defined flourishing and rights protection.**

**Legal transformation serves community empowerment. Rights-based law is a tool for collective liberation, not regulatory control.**
