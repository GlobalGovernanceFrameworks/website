*"Money becomes medicine when it flows toward healing rather than profit, when communities control resources rather than institutions extracting value, when traditional wisdom guides innovation rather than being displaced by it. The Global Mental Health Commons Fund transforms the very nature of how healing happens—not as commodity to be purchased, but as birthright to be nurtured through collective care and mutual aid."*
