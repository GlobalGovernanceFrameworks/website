**Remember: The commission exists to serve community healing and liberation, not institutional mental health systems. Its authority comes from community trust and democratic mandate, not government appointment or professional expertise. Build with community wisdom, govern through community authority, and measure success through community-defined flourishing.**

**National transformation begins with community sovereignty. The commission is a tool for collective empowerment, not bureaucratic control.**
