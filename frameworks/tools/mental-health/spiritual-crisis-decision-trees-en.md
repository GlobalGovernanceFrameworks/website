# Clinical Decision Trees for Spiritual Crises
## Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health

> *"Distinguishing spiritual emergence from pathology - clinical wisdom that honors the sacred in human experience."*

## Overview

These clinical decision trees provide mental health professionals with evidence-based protocols for distinguishing spiritual crises from psychiatric emergencies, ensuring that natural human experiences of transcendence, meaning-seeking, and spiritual transformation receive appropriate support rather than pathologization. The trees integrate traditional healing wisdom with contemporary clinical practice while maintaining cultural competency and individual dignity.

**Core Purpose**: Transform mental health response to spiritual experiences from suppression to support, from pathologization to recognition of natural human consciousness capacities.
