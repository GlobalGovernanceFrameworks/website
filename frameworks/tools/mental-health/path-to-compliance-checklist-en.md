## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### **Opposition Management** ⚠️
**Challenge**: Pharmaceutical industry resistance to traditional healing integration  
**Solution**: Demonstrate cost-effectiveness and community preference evidence, build coalitions with progressive healthcare workers, focus on integration rather than replacement

**Challenge**: Professional resistance to community authority  
**Solution**: Provide continuing education on collaborative practice models, create career incentives for community engagement, share success stories from other regions

### **Resource Constraints** ⚠️
**Challenge**: Limited budget for ≥5% allocation  
**Solution**: Demonstrate long-term cost savings, access Global Mental Health Commons Fund, implement phased approach with priority population focus

**Challenge**: Insufficient workforce for service expansion  
**Solution**: Task-shifting to community health workers, traditional healer integration, peer support specialist deployment, technology-assisted service delivery

### **Cultural Challenges** ⚠️
**Challenge**: Resistance to traditional healing integration  
**Solution**: Education about traditional healing effectiveness, start with willing communities, respect community choice, ensure cultural protocols

**Challenge**: Language and communication barriers  
**Solution**: Community interpreter training, service provision in local languages, cultural adaptation of materials, visual and non-verbal communication methods
