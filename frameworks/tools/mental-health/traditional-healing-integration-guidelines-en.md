The Traditional Healing Integration Guidelines represent a fundamental commitment to healing justiceâ€”recognizing that true mental health transformation requires honoring and integrating the wisdom of traditional healing alongside contemporary approaches. By implementing these guidelines, healthcare systems can move beyond cultural appropriation toward authentic partnership, beyond professional hierarchy toward collaborative equality, and beyond Western-only approaches toward truly comprehensive healing.

**Key Implementation Priorities**:

1. **Community Sovereignty**: Ensure traditional healing communities lead all aspects of integration planning and implementation

4. **Legal Framework**: Establish legal frameworks recognizing traditional healers as equal healthcare providers
5. **Resource Equity**: Ensure equal resource allocation and support for traditional healing and contemporary mental health services

**Call to Action**: Begin implementing traditional healing integration in your healthcare system, community, or practice. Start with relationship building, community consultation, and cultural competency development for all staff.

**Living Document Status**: This guideline is designed for continuous improvement based on implementation experience and traditional healing community feedback. Current version represents comprehensive analysis as of June 2025 with regular updates planned based on community guidance and emerging practices.
