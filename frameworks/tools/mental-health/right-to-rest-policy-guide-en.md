*"In reclaiming our right to rest, we reclaim our humanity. When we recognize that our worth extends far beyond our productivity, when we create time for contemplation, creativity, and community, when we honor the wisdom of cultures that understand rest as sacred—we transform not only our individual lives but the very foundations of how human societies organize themselves. The right to rest is the right to be fully human."*
