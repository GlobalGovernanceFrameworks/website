# Youth Mental Health Parliament Charter
## Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health

> *"Youth leadership, not youth consultation - meaningful power in mental health transformation by those who will inherit the world."*

## Charter Preamble

We, the young people of the world, recognize that mental health challenges disproportionately affect our generation through climate anxiety, economic uncertainty, digital culture impacts, educational pressure, and systemic oppression. We declare our right to meaningful leadership in mental health transformation rather than tokenistic consultation in decisions that shape our futures.

**We Affirm**:
- Youth possess unique expertise about contemporary mental health challenges and innovative solutions
- Meaningful participation requires decision-making authority, not advisory roles
- Mental health transformation must address systemic causes affecting young people globally
- Traditional healing wisdom and contemporary innovation must be integrated with youth leadership
- Climate change, economic inequality, and social justice are youth mental health issues requiring youth-led solutions

**We Establish** the Global Youth Mental Health Parliament as an autonomous body with binding authority over youth mental health policy, resource allocation, and system transformation worldwide.
