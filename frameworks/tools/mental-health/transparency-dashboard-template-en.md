## <a id="dashboard-architecture"></a>Dashboard Architecture Overview

### Community-Centered Information Design

**Transparency dashboards must serve community advocacy and healing rather than institutional compliance performance.**

Traditional accountability systems create information barriers that prevent communities from accessing data needed for effective advocacy. Community-centered transparency transforms data access into community empowerment.

#### **Core Architecture Principles**

**Community Information Sovereignty**:
```json
{
  "information_sovereignty_framework": {
    "community_ownership": "communities control how their mental health data is collected, analyzed, and shared",
    "data_governance": "community-controlled governance of mental health information and privacy",
    "advocacy_orientation": "information design prioritizes community advocacy and action over institutional reporting",
    "cultural_protocols": "information sharing honors cultural protocols and traditional knowledge protection",
    "accessibility_first": "information accessible to diverse communities and communication styles"
  }
}
```

**Accessibility and Community Access**:
- **Multiple Access Modes**: Visual, audio, text, and interactive access options for diverse communication preferences
- **Language Justice**: Information available in community languages including indigenous languages and sign languages
- **Technology Accessibility**: Dashboard accessible through various technology platforms and connectivity levels
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Information presentation designed for diverse cognitive styles and processing preferences
- **Cultural Accessibility**: Information presentation respectful of diverse cultural values and communication styles

#### **Dashboard Information Flow**

**Community-to-Action Information Architecture**:
```
Community Experience → Data Collection → Community Analysis → 
Transparency Display → Community Advocacy → System Change
```

**Traditional Accountability Flow** (Extractive):
```
Institutional Metrics → External Analysis → Compliance Reporting → 
Institutional Performance → Limited Community Access
```

**Community-Centered Flow** (Empowering):
```
Community Stories & Data → Community-Controlled Analysis → 
Accessible Community Dashboard → Community Advocacy → 
Community-Driven Change
```

## Conclusion: Transparency as Community Empowerment

The Transparency Dashboard Template transforms mental health accountability from institutional performance theater to community empowerment and advocacy. When communities control their own information and analysis, transparency becomes a tool for healing and transformation rather than compliance and surveillance.

This template provides comprehensive frameworks and tools for creating transparency dashboards that honor community sovereignty, support advocacy, and transform mental health accountability from top-down compliance to community-driven change. The most important elements are community control, cultural protocols, and accessibility for diverse communities.

**Remember**: Information belongs to communities. When we center community access to mental health data, we transform transparency from institutional accountability theater to community empowerment and advocacy for transformation.

**Your community's dashboard should serve your community's advocacy and healing. Trust your community's priorities, honor your cultural protocols, and maintain community control over your information and advocacy tools.**

## Framework Development Notes

This Transparency Dashboard Template synthesizes community-controlled technology principles, disability justice accessibility frameworks, and traditional knowledge protection protocols. The template prioritizes community sovereignty and cultural protocols while providing practical tools for transparency and accountability.

Development included consultation with community technology cooperatives, disability justice organizations, traditional knowledge keepers, and communities implementing community-controlled transparency and accountability systems. The template is designed for adaptation to diverse cultural contexts while maintaining core principles of community control and accessibility.

For additional technical support, community training resources, and connection with communities implementing transparency dashboards, access the complete Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health toolkit library.
