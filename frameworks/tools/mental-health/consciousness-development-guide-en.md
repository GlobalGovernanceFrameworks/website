This guide addresses mental health challenges arising from consciousness development and worldview transitions—the profound shifts in how individuals understand reality, meaning, and values that can trigger significant psychological distress. Unlike traditional spiritual crises, these developmental transitions involve fundamental changes in cognitive complexity, value systems, and meaning-making frameworks that require specialized support approaches.

**Core Purpose**: Transform mental health response to developmental transitions from pathologization to recognition of natural consciousness evolution, providing support that honors both the challenge and the growth potential of worldview transitions.

**Remember: This guide exists to serve consciousness evolution and human development, not to categorize or control natural developmental processes. Its authority comes from research integration and clinical wisdom, not from developmental superiority or stage hierarchy. Use with developmental humility, cultural competency, and recognition that consciousness development serves human flourishing and collective evolution.**

**Consciousness development support honors the natural evolution of human awareness while providing practical guidance for navigating the challenges and opportunities of worldview transitions. Every developmental stage has gifts and limitations - the goal is supporting healthy development rather than rushing toward higher stages.**
