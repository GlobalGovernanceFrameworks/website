## <a id="understanding-narrative-equity"></a>Understanding Narrative Equity

### The Foundation of Story-Centered Evaluation

**Narrative equity means communities control their own stories about mental health, healing, and transformation.**

Traditional evaluation extracts stories from communities for institutional use. Narrative equity ensures communities maintain ownership, interpretation, and action authority over their own stories and experiences.

#### **Core Principles of Narrative Equity**

**Story Sovereignty**: Communities control who tells stories, how stories are shared, and how stories are used for advocacy and change

**Cultural Story Protocols**: All storytelling honors cultural protocols and traditional ways of sharing wisdom and experience

**Healing-Centered Storytelling**: The storytelling process itself supports community healing and connection rather than extracting trauma for institutional use

**Action-Oriented Stories**: Stories are collected and shared to support community action and advocacy rather than academic research or institutional compliance

**Community-Defined Impact**: Communities define what stories matter and what changes stories should support

### Transforming Evaluation Through Story

#### **From Surveillance to Healing**
Traditional evaluation monitors communities to ensure compliance with institutional standards. Narrative equity evaluation supports community healing through shared storytelling and collective meaning-making.

**Surveillance Evaluation**:
- External evaluators asking predetermined questions
- Focus on deficits and problems rather than strengths and wisdom
- Stories extracted for institutional reporting purposes
- Community members as subjects rather than partners
- Evaluation disconnected from community priorities and action

**Healing-Centered Evaluation**:
- Community members as storytellers and interpreters
- Focus on community strengths, wisdom, and transformation
- Stories shared for community healing and empowerment
- Community members as partners and leaders in evaluation
- Evaluation designed to support community action and advocacy

#### **Community Authority in Story Interpretation**
**Traditional Approach**: External experts interpret community experiences and determine what stories mean for policy and practice

**Narrative Equity Approach**: Communities interpret their own experiences and determine how stories should be understood and used for change

## <a id="storytelling-protocols"></a>Community Storytelling Protocols

### Cultural and Healing-Centered Storytelling

## Conclusion: Stories as Medicine for Community Transformation

Narrative equity reviews transform evaluation from institutional surveillance to community healing, from story extraction to story sovereignty, from compliance measurement to liberation tracking. When communities control their own stories about mental health and healing, evaluation becomes a tool for community empowerment and transformation.

This guide provides frameworks and tools for communities to implement narrative equity reviews that honor community wisdom, protect story sovereignty, and support community goals for mental health transformation. The most important resources are the stories, wisdom, and healing knowledge that exist within every community.

**Remember**: Stories are medicine. When shared with cultural protocols and community consent, stories heal individuals, families, and communities while providing powerful evidence for advocacy and transformation.

**Your community's stories hold the wisdom needed for mental health transformation. Trust your community's knowledge, honor your cultural protocols, and remember that healing happens through shared storytelling and collective action.**

## Framework Development Notes

This Narrative Equity Review Process Guide represents a synthesis of community-based participatory evaluation approaches, traditional healing wisdom, and trauma-informed storytelling practices. The framework prioritizes community sovereignty and cultural protocols while providing practical tools for story-centered evaluation and advocacy.

Development included consultation with community mental health advocates, traditional healers, evaluation specialists focused on community-led approaches, and communities implementing story-based evaluation and advocacy. The guide is designed for adaptation to diverse cultural contexts while maintaining core principles of narrative equity and community control.
