### Value System Mapping Template

The *Value System Mapping Template* is a structured tool within the *Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework* designed to help stakeholders analyze and bridge cultural and worldview differences in conflict-affected contexts. By mapping value systems—using frameworks like Spiral Dynamics—this tool fosters culturally resonant peacebuilding strategies that promote trust, inclusion, and reconciliation. Aligned with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), UNDP peacebuilding principles, and OSCE conflict prevention protocols, the template supports community leaders, mediators, and policymakers in designing interventions that respect diverse values (see [Developmental Value Systems & Peace](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#developmental-value-systems)). The tool is adaptable to diverse contexts, including urban centers, rural areas, and fragile settings (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

#### 1. Purpose
The template enables stakeholders to:
- Identify and categorize value systems (e.g., traditional, modern, pluralistic) among stakeholders to understand cultural divides.
- Engage communities, including women, youth, and marginalized groups, in inclusive processes to surface values and worldviews.
- Design trauma-informed and culturally sensitive interventions, such as dialogues or mediation, that bridge value-based conflicts (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health]).
- Integrate value system insights with local governance and global frameworks (e.g., UNDP, OSCE) to enhance peacebuilding effectiveness.

#### 2. Components
The template includes the following components, each supported by templates and guidance:
- **Stakeholder Value Identification**: Collect data on values and worldviews from diverse actors.
- **Value System Categorization**: Classify values into developmental stages (e.g., Spiral Dynamics levels).
- **Conflict and Opportunity Analysis**: Assess how value differences drive conflict or enable collaboration.
- **Intervention Design**: Develop strategies to bridge divides and leverage shared values.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Process
Follow these steps to map value systems and design interventions, adaptable for digital or non-digital settings:

1. **Define the Context and Objectives**:
   - **Objective**: Clarify the purpose of value system mapping (e.g., reduce cultural tensions, inform dialogue).
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Conflict Analysis Framework* to identify cultural and value-based conflict drivers (see [Conflict Analysis Framework](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#conflict-analysis-framework)).
     - Engage community leaders to align objectives with local priorities, ensuring trauma sensitivity (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health]).
     - Define the scope (e.g., community, region) and target stakeholders.
   - **Output**: Mapping objectives summary (1 page or oral brief for low-literacy groups).

2. **Identify Stakeholder Values**:
   - **Objective**: Collect data on values and worldviews from diverse actors.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Stakeholder Mapping Template* to identify stakeholders (e.g., elders, youth, women, minorities) (see [Multi-Track Dialogue Protocol](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#multi-track-dialogue-protocol)).
     - Gather data via *Multi-Track Dialogue Protocol* or storytelling workshops, using *Nonviolent Communication (NVC)* to ensure inclusive, trauma-sensitive engagement (see [Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#trauma-informed-toolkit)).
     - In digital settings, deploy *Participatory Sensing Networks* or surveys; in non-digital settings, use *Paper-Based Value Surveys* or oral interviews.
   - **Output**: Stakeholder value profiles with key values and priorities.

3. **Categorize Value Systems**:
   - **Objective**: Classify values into developmental stages to understand worldview divides.
   - **Actions**:
     - Apply the *Value System Mapping Chart* to categorize values using frameworks like Spiral Dynamics (e.g., Red: power-driven, Blue: tradition-driven, Orange: achievement-driven, Green: pluralistic).
     - Identify dominant and emerging value systems (e.g., traditional vs. modern) and their influence on conflict.
     - Validate categorizations with community input, using *Community Radio Scripts* or focus groups for accessibility.
   - **Output**: Completed *Value System Mapping Chart* with categorized values.

4. **Analyze Conflicts and Opportunities**:
   - **Objective**: Assess how value differences drive conflict or enable collaboration.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Value Conflict Analysis Template* to map tensions (e.g., tradition vs. pluralism) and opportunities (e.g., shared values like community safety).
     - Cross-reference with *Psychosocial Impact Assessment Guide* to evaluate trauma-related value conflicts (see [Measuring Peace Governance Success](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#measuring-success)).
     - Identify bridge-building values that can unify stakeholders, informed by *Early Warning System Design Guide* indicators (see [Early Warning System Design Guide](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#early-warning-system-design-guide)).
   - **Output**: Value conflict and opportunity report with prioritized issues.

5. **Design Culturally Resonant Interventions**:
   - **Objective**: Develop strategies to bridge value divides and leverage shared values.
   - **Actions**:
     - Create a *Value-Based Intervention Plan Template* outlining interventions, such as:
       - Dialogues: Use *Multi-Track Dialogue Protocol* to facilitate value-aligned discussions.
       - Mediation: Apply *Local Peace Committee Charter Template* for value-sensitive resolutions.
       - Education: Develop community workshops to foster mutual understanding of values.
     - Ensure interventions are trauma-informed, using *Community Healing Protocol* (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health]).
     - Validate interventions with stakeholders via *Digital Safe Spaces* or community meetings.
   - **Output**: Completed *Value-Based Intervention Plan Template*.

6. **Implement and Evaluate**:
   - **Objective**: Deploy interventions and assess their impact on value alignment.
   - **Actions**:
     - Implement interventions through *Local Peace Committees* or dialogue sessions, using *Paper-Based Dialogue Templates* or online platforms (see [Local Peace Committee Charter Template](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#local-peace-committee-charter-template)).
     - Monitor impact using *Psychosocial Metrics* and community feedback, ensuring ethical deployment with *Peace-Technology Ethics Assessment* (see [Peace-Technology Ethics Assessment](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#peace-technology-ethics-assessment)).
     - Refine interventions based on evaluation, updating value mappings as needed.
   - **Output**: Evaluation report with recommendations for ongoing alignment.

#### 4. Implementation Modes
The template is adaptable to diverse contexts:
- **Digital Implementation**:
  - Use online surveys or *Social Media Monitoring* to collect value data, processed with *AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis* (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure]).
  - Store mappings securely with *Blockchain-Based Truth Logs* for transparency in low-trust settings.
  - Host virtual workshops via *Digital Safe Spaces*, moderated to prevent misinformation (see [AI & Digital Peace Ethics](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#ai-ethics]).
- **Non-Digital Implementation**:
  - Use *Paper-Based Value Surveys* and *Oral Storytelling Guides* for low-literacy or low-connectivity communities, translated into local languages.
  - Conduct community workshops to map values, using storytelling and role-playing, as piloted in South Sudan’s healing circles.
  - Share outcomes via *Community Radio Scripts* or public assemblies (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health)).
- **Hybrid Implementation**:
  - Combine digital and non-digital methods (e.g., SMS feedback synced with *IPFS-Based Community Reporting*) to bridge connectivity gaps (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

#### 5. Case Studies
- **Rwanda (1994–2015)**: Value system mapping identified tensions between traditional (Blue) and modern (Orange) worldviews post-genocide. *Community Truth-Telling Forums*, guided by the *Value-Based Intervention Plan*, bridged divides, fostering reconciliation through shared values of community healing, impacting 1.9 million cases (see [Transitional Justice & Reconciliation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#transitional-justice)).
- **Afghanistan (2001–2021)**: Mapping revealed conflicts between tribal (Red) and pluralistic (Green) values in rural areas. *Multi-Track Dialogues* and *Local Peace Committees*, informed by value mappings, reduced local disputes by 25% by aligning interventions with tribal honor codes (see [Local Conflict Resolution Implementation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#local-implementation)).
