# Resource Mapping Tool for Community Peacebuilding

## Introduction

In low-resource contexts, successful peacebuilding often depends on recognizing and mobilizing resources beyond money. Communities typically possess a wealth of non-financial assets—from meeting spaces and transportation to skills and social networks—that can support peace initiatives without requiring external funding. This Resource Mapping Tool helps communities systematically identify, value, and mobilize these hidden resources for sustainable peacebuilding.

### Purpose of This Tool

This Resource Mapping Tool will help your community:
- Discover the full range of resources available for peace initiatives
- Value non-monetary contributions equitably
- Make resource mobilization more inclusive and accessible
- Reduce dependency on external funding
- Design peace initiatives that build on existing community strengths
- Create sustainable resource-sharing systems for long-term peace

### Who Should Use This Tool

- Local Peace Committees and community peace initiatives
- Community leaders and facilitators
- Women's groups and youth organizations
- Traditional and religious leaders
- Civil society organizations supporting community peacebuilding

- Organizational capacity from women's group leaders
- Youth energy for building and maintenance

**Social Resources:**
- Women's marketing associations providing network support
- Connections to district officials through respected members
- Relationships with religious leaders for legitimacy
- Communication channels through market day gatherings

**Cultural Resources:**
- Traditional women's peace rituals integrated into mediation
- Stories and proverbs used in conflict resolution
- Cultural symbols of women's authority in domestic matters
- Traditional agreements reinforced by cultural practices

**Results:**
The resource mapping enabled establishment of Peace Huts with minimal external support. Using locally-available resources created community ownership and sustainability. The Peace Huts became self-sustaining through small gardens and contribution systems, while successfully resolving hundreds of conflicts.

### Case Study 2: Youth Peace Council Resource Mobilization

In an urban area with high youth unemployment and gang violence, a youth peace initiative conducted resource mapping focused on young people's often-overlooked assets:

**Physical Resources:**
- Underutilized community center spaces during off-peak hours

- Mobile phones for communication and documentation
- Artistic materials from school contributions

**Human Resources:**
- Artistic talents (music, art, drama) among youth
- Sports skills and leadership from team captains
- Technology knowledge from school-educated youth
- Experience of former gang members in understanding conflict

**Social Resources:**
- Extensive peer networks across different neighborhoods
- Connections to teachers and school administrators
- Relationships with younger children who respected older youth
- Social media networks and communication channels

**Cultural Resources:**
- Popular music and dance styles with positive messages
- Street art traditions that could promote peace
- Sports rivalries that could be channeled positively
- Youth cultural events with convening power

**Results:**
The mapping revealed abundant resources controlled by youth themselves. A Youth Peace Council mobilized these resources to create peace-themed sports tournaments, arts events, and peer mediation. Using their own resources gave youth ownership of the peace process and challenged perceptions that youth were merely problems or beneficiaries rather than peace agents.

### Case Study 3: Resource Mapping Across Conflict Lines

In a region divided by farmer-herder conflicts over land and water resources, facilitators conducted careful resource mapping with both communities:

**Physical Resources:**
- Neutral meeting places acceptable to both groups

- Communication tools accessible to both communities

**Human Resources:**
- Respected elders from both communities with historical relationships
- Religious leaders trusted across community lines
- Women from both groups with trading relationships
- Youth with cross-community friendships from school

**Social Resources:**
- Market day interactions providing regular contact
- Interdependent economic relationships and trade
- Religious gatherings with cross-community participation
- Historical alliances and cooperation precedents

**Cultural Resources:**
- Shared cultural celebrations and festivals
- Common religious values emphasizing peace
- Traditional conflict resolution mechanisms recognized by both groups
- Historical peace agreements and their symbols

**Results:**
The resource mapping identified previously unrecognized assets for peace. By focusing on shared or complementary resources, communities established a joint natural resource management committee and revitalized traditional conflict resolution mechanisms. The process highlighted mutual dependencies and common interests, changing conflict narratives and creating practical cooperation.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How can we map resources without creating expectations we can't meet?**
A: Be clear from the beginning that the process is about identifying what the community already has and how to use it more effectively for peace, not about generating new external resources. Focus on the value of existing assets and how they can be better mobilized.

**Q: How do we handle power imbalances in resource control?**
A: Acknowledge these realities openly while looking for resources that are more equitably accessible. Work with influential resource controllers to demonstrate the community-wide benefits of more inclusive resource use. Start with resources that have fewer power sensitivities.

**Q: How can we value very different types of contributions fairly?**
A: Involve the community in creating locally meaningful equivalencies between different resource types. Focus on the impact of contributions rather than their market value. Consider traditional systems of exchange and reciprocity that may already exist in the community.

**Q: What if people don't want to share their resources?**
A: Respect individual choices about resource sharing. Focus first on community members most willing to contribute, creating positive examples. Ensure clear agreements about how resources will be used, maintained, and returned if applicable. Build trust through transparent tracking and recognition.

**Q: How do we sustain resource mapping and mobilization long-term?**
A: Integrate resource discussions into regular community meetings and decision-making. Create simple, sustainable documentation systems that don't require special materials or skills. Develop a rotating resource coordination role. Regularly celebrate and recognize contributions to maintain motivation.

## Conclusion

Resource mapping reveals that even in low-resource contexts, communities possess significant assets for peacebuilding when viewed through a different lens. By systematically identifying, valuing, and mobilizing existing resources—physical, human, social, and cultural—communities can reduce dependency on external funding while building more sustainable, locally-owned peace processes.

The resource mapping process itself often becomes a peacebuilding activity, bringing diverse community members together around shared goals and highlighting interdependencies. As communities discover and mobilize their own peace resources, they simultaneously build confidence, capacity, and social cohesion—essential foundations for lasting peace.

This Resource Mapping Tool provides practical approaches adaptable to various contexts, from rural villages to urban neighborhoods, stable settings to active conflicts. By starting with existing community strengths rather than focusing on deficits, resource mapping creates new possibilities for peace action even in the most challenging circumstances.
