### Peace-Technology Ethics Assessment

The *Peace-Technology Ethics Assessment* is a structured tool within the *Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework* designed to help stakeholders evaluate the ethical implications of deploying technologies in peacebuilding initiatives. Aligned with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), UNDP peacebuilding principles, and OSCE human rights standards, this assessment ensures technologies (e.g., AI, blockchain, social media monitoring) uphold equity, privacy, inclusivity, and non-maleficence while mitigating risks like surveillance, bias, or re-traumatization (see [AI & Digital Peace Ethics](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#ai-ethics)). The tool is adaptable to diverse contexts, including high-tech democracies, post-conflict states, and fragile settings (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

#### 1. Purpose
The assessment enables stakeholders to:
- Evaluate the ethical risks and benefits of technologies used in peacebuilding (e.g., *AI-Driven Conflict Prediction*, *Digital Safe Spaces*, *Blockchain-Based Truth Logs*).
- Ensure technologies align with human rights, cultural sensitivity, and trauma-informed principles, avoiding harm to vulnerable communities.
- Engage diverse stakeholders, including women, youth, and marginalized groups, in assessing technology impacts.
- Develop mitigation strategies to address ethical concerns, integrating with local governance and global frameworks (e.g., UNDP, OSCE).

#### 2. Components
The assessment includes the following components, each supported by templates and guidance:
- **Technology Scoping**: Identify the technology, its purpose, and its peacebuilding application.
- **Stakeholder Consultation**: Engage communities and experts to assess impacts and concerns.
- **Risk-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate ethical risks (e.g., bias, privacy violations) and benefits (e.g., efficiency, transparency).
- **Mitigation and Implementation Plan**: Design strategies to address risks and ensure ethical deployment.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Process
Follow these steps to conduct a peace-technology ethics assessment, adaptable for digital or non-digital settings:

1. **Scope the Technology and Context**:
   - **Objective**: Define the technology, its purpose, and the peacebuilding context.
   - **Actions**:
     - Document the technology’s features, intended use (e.g., monitoring hate speech, securing dialogue records), and deployment context (e.g., urban, fragile state).
     - Use the *Conflict Analysis Framework* to understand conflict dynamics and technology relevance (see [Conflict Analysis Framework](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#conflict-analysis-framework)).
     - Identify potential users and affected communities, prioritizing marginalized groups.
   - **Output**: Technology scoping summary (1 page or oral brief for low-literacy groups).

2. **Engage Stakeholders**:
   - **Objective**: Gather input from diverse actors to assess ethical implications.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Stakeholder Mapping Template* to identify stakeholders (e.g., technologists, community leaders, women, youth) (see [Multi-Track Dialogue Protocol](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#multi-track-dialogue-protocol)).
     - Conduct consultations via *Multi-Track Dialogue Protocol*, using *Digital Safe Spaces* for virtual engagement or community workshops for non-digital settings (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure]).
     - Apply *Nonviolent Communication (NVC)* to ensure inclusive, trauma-sensitive discussions (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health)).
   - **Output**: Stakeholder consultation report with concerns and recommendations.

3. **Conduct Risk-Benefit Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Evaluate ethical risks and benefits of the technology.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use the *Peace-Technology Ethics Checklist* to assess risks, including:
       - **Privacy**: Does the technology collect sensitive data (e.g., biometric data, personal identities)?
       - **Bias**: Could algorithms perpetuate discrimination (e.g., ethnic profiling in AI models)?
       - **Access**: Is the technology equitable for low-literacy or low-connectivity communities?
       - **Trauma**: Could deployment exacerbate trauma (e.g., graphic content in social media monitoring)?
       - **Misuse**: Could the technology be weaponized (e.g., surveillance in authoritarian regimes)?
     - Evaluate benefits, such as improved transparency, scalability, or community empowerment.
     - Cross-reference with *Value System Mapping Template* to ensure cultural alignment (see [Developmental Value Systems & Peace](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#developmental-value-systems)).
   - **Output**: Risk-benefit analysis report with prioritized concerns.

4. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**:
   - **Objective**: Design actions to address ethical risks and enhance benefits.
   - **Actions**:
     - Create a *Risk Mitigation Plan Template* outlining strategies, such as:
       - Privacy: Implement end-to-end encryption or anonymization (e.g., in *Blockchain-Based Truth Logs*).
       - Bias: Conduct regular algorithm audits and diversify training data.
       - Access: Provide non-digital alternatives (e.g., *Paper-Based Reporting Templates*).
       - Trauma: Use *Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit* to train operators (see [Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#trauma-informed-toolkit]).
       - Misuse: Establish oversight mechanisms via *Local Peace Committees* (see [Local Peace Committee Charter Template](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#local-peace-committee-charter-template)).
     - Align mitigation with human rights frameworks (e.g., UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights).
   - **Output**: Completed *Risk Mitigation Plan Template*.

5. **Implement and Monitor**:
   - **Objective**: Deploy the technology ethically and monitor its impact.
   - **Actions**:
     - Integrate the mitigation plan into technology deployment, using *Early Warning System Design Guide* for monitoring protocols (see [Early Warning System Design Guide](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#early-warning-system-design-guide)).
     - Train operators in ethical use, leveraging *Community Radio Scripts* or online tutorials for accessibility.
     - Monitor impacts using *Psychosocial Impact Assessment Guide* to track community trust and trauma effects (see [Measuring Peace Governance Success](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#measuring-success)).
   - **Output**: Operational technology with monitoring plan.

6. **Evaluate and Refine**:
   - **Objective**: Assess the technology’s ethical performance and refine as needed.
   - **Actions**:
     - Collect feedback via *Participatory Sensing Networks*, surveys, or community meetings.
     - Evaluate ethical outcomes (e.g., privacy breaches, inclusivity gaps) using *Peace-Technology Ethics Checklist*.
     - Update the mitigation plan based on feedback, ensuring alignment with local needs and global standards.
   - **Output**: Evaluation report with recommendations for refinement.

#### 4. Implementation Modes
The assessment is adaptable to diverse contexts:
- **Digital Implementation**:
  - Use online platforms (e.g., Google Forms) for stakeholder consultations and *AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis* to process feedback (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure]).
  - Store assessment records securely with *Blockchain-Based Truth Logs* for transparency in low-trust settings.
  - Host virtual workshops via *Digital Safe Spaces*, moderated to prevent misinformation (see [AI & Digital Peace Ethics](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#ai-ethics]).
- **Non-Digital Implementation**:
  - Use *Paper-Based Ethics Checklists* and *Oral Assessment Guides* for low-literacy or low-connectivity communities, translated into local languages.
  - Conduct community workshops to gather input, using storytelling and role-playing, as piloted in South Sudan’s healing circles.
  - Share outcomes via *Community Radio Scripts* or public assemblies (see [Mental Health & Psychosocial Support](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#mental-health)).
- **Hybrid Implementation**:
  - Combine digital and non-digital methods (e.g., SMS feedback synced with *IPFS-Based Community Reporting*) to bridge connectivity gaps (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

#### 5. Case Studies
- **Myanmar (2017–2025)**: An ethics assessment of *Social Media Monitoring* for hate speech detection identified risks of ethnic profiling and privacy violations. Mitigation included algorithm audits and *Digital Safe Spaces*, reducing harmful content exposure by 30% while protecting user data (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure)).
- **Ukraine (2014–2025)**: Assessing *AI-Driven Conflict Prediction* for ceasefire monitoring revealed access barriers for rural communities. Non-digital *Paper-Based Reporting Templates* and *Community Radio Scripts* were introduced, ensuring 80% community participation and ethical deployment (see [Early Warning System Design Guide](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#early-warning-system-design-guide)).
