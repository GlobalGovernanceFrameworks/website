# Causal Loop Diagramming Template
## A Systems Thinking Tool for Peace & Conflict Resolution

## Introduction

Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) are powerful tools for visualizing how different variables in a conflict system interact through reinforcing or balancing feedback loops. By mapping these relationships, practitioners can identify system patterns, anticipate unintended consequences, and discover high-leverage intervention points that may otherwise remain hidden.

This template provides a structured approach to creating CLDs for conflict analysis and peacebuilding, helping you move beyond linear thinking to understand the complex, dynamic nature of conflicts.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this Causal Loop Diagramming template when you need to:

- Understand the underlying structure of a persistent conflict
- Identify reinforcing loops that escalate conflict
- Find balancing loops that might stabilize or de-escalate conflict
- Anticipate potential unintended consequences of interventions
- Communicate complex conflict dynamics to stakeholders
- Discover high-leverage intervention points with maximum impact
- Facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue about system dynamics

## The Process

### Step 1: Define the System Boundary

Before starting your diagram, define what's in and what's out of your analysis.

**Questions to ask:**
- What specific conflict aspect are you mapping?
- What timeframe are you considering?
- What geographic scope applies?
- Which stakeholders are central to the analysis?

**Example:** For analyzing intercommunal tensions in a shared resource area, you might focus on water resource allocation conflicts between two communities over the past five years within a specific watershed, including farmers, herders, local officials, and water management authorities.

### Step 2: Identify Key Variables

List the important factors, conditions, or elements that influence the conflict situation.

**Guidelines for selecting variables:**
- Choose variables that can increase or decrease (quantities, not events)
- Use neutral language rather than directional terms
- Include only the most significant variables (10-20 maximum for clarity)
- Consider different types of variables:
  - Social (trust levels, group cohesion, polarization)
  - Political (governance capacity, political inclusion)
  - Economic (resource allocation, economic inequality)
  - Cultural (intergroup attitudes, identity threat perceptions)
  - Environmental (resource scarcity, land degradation)

**Example variables:**
- Water availability
- Intercommunal trust
- Agricultural production
- Grazing land access
- Political representation of minority groups
- Militia recruitment
- Displacement levels
- Economic interdependence

### Step 3: Map Causal Connections

Draw arrows between variables to show causal relationships. Each arrow should indicate how one variable affects another.

**Notation:**
- **Positive links (+)**: When variable A increases, variable B also increases (or when A decreases, B decreases)
- **Negative links (-)**: When variable A increases, variable B decreases (or when A decreases, B increases)

**Examples:**
- Water availability (+) → Agricultural production (as water increases, agricultural production increases)
- Agricultural production (-) → Land available for grazing (as agricultural production increases, grazing land decreases)
- Political marginalization (+) → Grievances (as marginalization increases, grievances increase)

### Step 4: Identify Feedback Loops

Look for closed loops of causal connections. These are the feedback structures that drive system behavior over time.

**Two types of feedback loops:**

**1. Reinforcing Loops (R)**: Loops that amplify change and drive growth or decline. These often drive escalation in conflicts.

**Example Reinforcing Loop in a Conflict Context:**
```
Intercommunal violence → Fear and trauma → In-group solidarity → Dehumanization of the other → Intercommunal violence
```

**2. Balancing Loops (B)**: Loops that counteract change and promote stability or goal-seeking behavior. These can represent de-escalation mechanisms or constraints in a conflict.

**Example Balancing Loop in a Conflict Context:**
```
Escalating violence → Economic costs → Pressure from business community → Peace negotiations → Reduction in violence
```

### Step 5: Analyze Loop Dominance

Determine which loops dominate the system at different times.

**Questions to consider:**
- Which loops are currently driving system behavior?
- Under what conditions might different loops become dominant?
- How do reinforcing and balancing loops interact?
- Where are there delays in the system that affect timing?

**Example:** In early stages of a resource conflict, reinforcing loops around fear and in-group solidarity may dominate, driving escalation. Later, balancing loops related to economic costs or external intervention may become stronger, contributing to de-escalation.

### Step 6: Identify Leverage Points

Look for places in the system where small changes could lead to large effects.

**High-leverage points often include:**
- Variables that appear in multiple loops
- Drivers of reinforcing loops that can be interrupted
- Places where delays can be shortened or extended
- Places where information flows can be improved
- Deep structural elements (goals, rules, mindsets, paradigms)

**Example leverage points:**
- Joint resource management mechanisms (affecting trust and cooperation)
- Inclusive political representation (affecting grievances and legitimacy)
- Early warning systems (affecting information flows and response times)
- Youth peace education programs (affecting long-term attitudes and perceptions)

## Practical Application Guide

### Drawing the Diagram

1. **Start with key variables** placed in a circular arrangement with space between them
2. **Draw causal links** with arrows, marking each as positive (+) or negative (-)
3. **Identify and label loops** as reinforcing (R) or balancing (B)
4. **Add notes about delays** where effects take time to materialize
5. **Highlight leverage points** where interventions might be most effective

### Using Software Tools

Several tools can help create professional CLDs:

- **Vensim**: Professional system dynamics software with a free PLE version
- **STELLA**: User-friendly system dynamics software
- **Mental Modeler**: Designed specifically for participatory modeling
- **Loopy**: Simple, free, web-based tool for quick CLDs

### Participatory Approach

For maximum insight and buy-in, develop CLDs through participatory processes:

1. **Prepare**: Brief participants on CLD basics and methodology
2. **Individual mapping**: Have participants identify variables and connections from their perspective
3. **Small group synthesis**: Combine individual maps in small, mixed stakeholder groups
4. **Large group integration**: Create a composite map with the full group
5. **Analysis**: Collectively identify key loops and leverage points
6. **Reflection**: Discuss insights and intervention implications

## Example: Intercommunal Resource Conflict CLD

Below is a simplified example of a causal loop diagram for an intercommunal resource conflict:

### Key Variables:
- Water scarcity
- Competition for resources
- Intercommunal trust
- Violence between communities
- Economic interdependence
- Displacement
- Traditional conflict resolution effectiveness
- External intervention

### Reinforcing Loops:
- **R1: Conflict Escalation Loop**
  - Water scarcity → Competition for resources → Violence between communities → Displacement → Further resource pressure → Increased water scarcity

- **R2: Trust Deterioration Loop**
  - Violence between communities → Decreased intercommunal trust → Reduced cooperation on resource management → Increased competition for resources → More violence between communities

### Balancing Loops:
- **B1: Traditional Resolution Loop**
  - Violence between communities → Activation of traditional conflict resolution mechanisms → Reduced violence between communities

- **B2: External Intervention Loop**
  - Sustained violence → External intervention → Temporary reduction in violence

- **B3: Economic Interdependence Loop**
  - Economic interdependence → Incentives for cooperation → Increased intercommunal trust → Reduced violence

### Leverage Points:
1. Joint water management systems (affects multiple loops)
2. Support for traditional conflict resolution mechanisms (strengthens balancing loop B1)
3. Programs promoting economic interdependence (strengthens balancing loop B3)
4. Early warning systems for resource stress (addresses delays in system response)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Including too many variables**: Focus on the most relevant factors to keep the diagram readable
2. **Confusing correlation with causation**: Ensure arrows represent actual causal relationships
3. **Using events rather than variables**: Use quantifiable conditions that can increase or decrease
4. **Omitting important feedback loops**: Look beyond linear cause-effect to closed loops
5. **Ignoring delays**: Note where effects take time to materialize
6. **Missing external influences**: Consider exogenous factors that affect the system
7. **Creating a static diagram**: Remember that loop dominance shifts over time

## Next Steps After Creating Your CLD

1. **Validate with stakeholders**: Check if the diagram reflects different perspectives
2. **Test mental models**: Use the CLD to challenge assumptions about how the conflict operates
3. **Identify intervention portfolios**: Design multiple interventions that address different parts of the system
4. **Monitor system evolution**: Update the CLD as the conflict context changes
5. **Move to quantitative modeling**: For detailed analysis, consider converting key relationships to a stock-and-flow model
6. **Communicate insights**: Use the CLD to build shared understanding among stakeholders
