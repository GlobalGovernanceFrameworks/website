# Systemic Stakeholder Mapping
## A Systems Thinking Tool for Peace & Conflict Resolution

## Introduction

Systemic Stakeholder Mapping goes beyond traditional stakeholder analysis by examining not just who the actors are, but how they relate to each other within the broader conflict system. This tool helps practitioners understand the complex web of relationships, power dynamics, resource flows, and feedback loops that connect stakeholders in a conflict setting.

By mapping stakeholders through a systems lens, practitioners can identify leverage points for intervention, potential coalitions for peace, hidden influencers, and systemic patterns that perpetuate conflict or might support sustainable peace.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this Systemic Stakeholder Mapping template when you need to:

- Understand the complex network of relationships between conflict actors
- Identify hidden influencers who may not be immediately visible
- Analyze power dynamics and how they affect conflict trajectories
- Discover potential alliances or coalitions for peace
- Map resource and information flows between stakeholders
- Identify leverage points for intervention within the stakeholder system
- Prepare for multi-stakeholder dialogue or mediation processes
- Design inclusive peacebuilding interventions that engage all relevant actors

## The Process

### Step 1: Identify the Conflict Boundary

Before mapping stakeholders, define the boundaries of the conflict system you're analyzing.

**Questions to ask:**
- What specific aspect of the conflict are you focusing on?
- What is the geographic scope of your analysis?
- What timeframe are you considering?
- What level are you working at (local, national, regional, international)?

**Example:** If analyzing a resource conflict in a border region, you might focus on water access disputes in the past three years in a specific watershed area, involving local communities, regional authorities, and national government actors.

### Step 2: List All Potential Stakeholders

Cast a wide net to identify all actors who influence or are influenced by the conflict.

**Categories to consider:**
- **Primary stakeholders**: Directly affected by or involved in the conflict
- **Secondary stakeholders**: Indirectly affected or with indirect influence
- **Tertiary stakeholders**: External actors with interest or influence
- **Visible stakeholders**: Openly involved in the conflict
- **Hidden stakeholders**: Less visible but potentially influential
- **Marginalized stakeholders**: Often excluded from formal processes

**Examples of stakeholder types:**
- Local communities and identity groups
- Government authorities at various levels
- Armed groups and security forces
- Civil society organizations
- Religious institutions and leaders
- Business and economic actors
- Regional organizations
- International institutions
- Donor agencies
- Diaspora communities
- Media outlets
- Educational institutions
- Traditional/customary authorities
- Youth and women's groups

### Step 3: Map Basic Stakeholder Attributes

For each identified stakeholder, document key characteristics that define their role in the system.

**Attributes to map:**
- **Interests**: What are their goals, concerns, and motivations?
- **Positions**: What are their public stances on key conflict issues?
- **Needs**: What are their underlying needs (security, recognition, justice, etc.)?
- **Resources**: What assets, capabilities, or resources do they control?
- **Power**: What types and levels of power do they hold in the system?
- **Legitimacy**: What sources of legitimacy do they draw upon?
- **Willingness to engage**: How open are they to dialogue or peacebuilding?
- **Conflict/peace roles**: Are they primarily conflict drivers, peace agents, or both?
- **Internal divisions**: Are there significant divisions within this stakeholder group?

### Step 4: Analyze Stakeholder Relationships

Map the connections and relationships between stakeholders to understand the system's structure.

**Types of relationships to map:**
- **Alliances and cooperation**: Who works together and why?
- **Tensions and conflicts**: Who is in opposition and over what issues?
- **Power dynamics**: Who has influence over whom?
- **Resource flows**: Who provides resources, funding, or support to whom?
- **Information flows**: How does information travel between stakeholders?
- **Formal relationships**: Official connections through institutions or agreements
- **Informal relationships**: Unofficial connections through personal ties or shared interests
- **Historical relationships**: How relationships have evolved over time
- **Trust/distrust dynamics**: Where trust exists or is broken in the system

**Using visual relationship mapping:**
- Use different line types to represent different relationships (solid for strong, dotted for weak)
- Use arrows to show direction of influence or resource flow
- Use different colors to represent positive, negative, or neutral relationships
- Indicate the strength of relationships (strong, moderate, weak)
- Note where relationships are changing or in flux

### Step 5: Identify Subsystems and Feedback Loops

Look for patterns of interaction that form subsystems or feedback loops within the stakeholder network.

**Elements to identify:**
- **Stakeholder clusters**: Groups of closely connected stakeholders
- **Bridging actors**: Stakeholders that connect otherwise separate clusters
- **Reinforcing loops**: Patterns of interaction that escalate conflict or build peace
- **Balancing loops**: Patterns that maintain stability or status quo
- **Gatekeepers**: Actors who control access to other stakeholders or resources
- **Information hubs**: Actors who serve as key nodes for information flow
- **Resource centers**: Actors who control or distribute critical resources

**Example subsystems:**
- Political elites and security forces reinforcing each other's power
- Civil society organizations and international donors creating accountability pressure
- Media outlets and polarized community groups amplifying divisions
- Traditional authorities and youth groups bridging community divides

### Step 6: Analyze System Dynamics and Leverage Points

Examine how the entire stakeholder system functions and identify potential points for intervention.

**Questions to consider:**
- What patterns of interaction perpetuate conflict?
- What relationships could be leveraged to build peace?
- Where are potential coalition-building opportunities?
- Which stakeholders serve as connectors or dividers?
- Where are misperceptions or information gaps most problematic?
- Which stakeholders have untapped potential for peacebuilding?
- Where might small changes create larger ripple effects?
- Which subsystems need to be transformed or strengthened?

**Types of leverage points:**
- **Bridging relationships**: Creating or strengthening connections between divided groups
- **Influencing key actors**: Engaging stakeholders with high influence on multiple others
- **Shifting information flows**: Improving how information moves through the system
- **Building new coalitions**: Creating collaborative networks for specific peace goals
- **Transforming destructive feedback loops**: Interrupting patterns that escalate conflict
- **Empowering marginalized voices**: Increasing influence of excluded stakeholders
- **Addressing power imbalances**: Creating more equitable distribution of power and resources

## Practical Application Guide

### Creating Visual Maps

There are multiple approaches to visualizing stakeholder systems:

1. **Network maps**: Nodes (stakeholders) connected by lines (relationships)
   - Use size of nodes to indicate power or influence
   - Use colors to categorize stakeholders by type
   - Use line types to show relationship qualities

2. **Systems maps**: Causal loop diagrams showing how stakeholders influence each other
   - Include feedback loops between stakeholders
   - Mark relationship dynamics as positive (+) or negative (-)
   - Indicate delay effects where relevant

3. **Power/interest matrices**: Map stakeholders by their power and interest levels
   - Add relationship lines between stakeholders
   - Group stakeholders into subsystems
   - Add dynamics like tension, collaboration, or resource flow

### Using Mapping Software

Several tools can help create systemic stakeholder maps:

- **Kumu.io**: Web-based platform specifically designed for relationship mapping
- **NodeXL**: Excel template for network analysis and visualization
- **Gephi**: Open-source software for network visualization and analysis
- **Vensim**: System dynamics software useful for causal loop mapping
- **Draw.io**: Simple diagramming tool for basic stakeholder maps
- **VUE (Visual Understanding Environment)**: Free concept mapping software

### Participatory Mapping Approach

For deeper insights and greater stakeholder buy-in, conduct mapping as a participatory process:

1. **Preparation**: Identify diverse representatives from different stakeholder groups
2. **Individual perspectives**: Have participants map the system from their viewpoint
3. **Small group integration**: Combine perspectives in mixed stakeholder groups
4. **System validation**: Review the combined map with all participants
5. **Collaborative analysis**: Jointly identify patterns, subsystems, and leverage points
6. **Action planning**: Use insights to design intervention strategies together

**Facilitation tips:**
- Create a safe space for honest sharing
- Acknowledge different perspectives as valid
- Use physical materials (cards, sticky notes, string) for tactile engagement
- Document the process and evolving maps
- Allow time for reflection on discoveries and insights
- Address power dynamics in the mapping process itself

## Example: Urban Community Conflict Systemic Stakeholder Map

Below is a simplified example for an urban community experiencing tensions between different ethnic groups, with issues related to housing, policing, and political representation:

### Key Stakeholders:

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- Community A residents (majority ethnic group)
- Community B residents (minority ethnic group)
- Local police department
- Municipal government
- Neighborhood associations (segregated by ethnicity)
- Business owners (primarily from Community A)
- Youth gangs (present in both communities)
- Religious institutions (separate for each community)

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- City school system
- Local media outlets
- Civil society organizations
- Housing authority
- Political parties
- Healthcare providers
- Social service agencies

**Tertiary Stakeholders:**
- National government agencies
- External donors and NGOs
- Regional business interests
- Diaspora communities

### Key Relationships and Subsystems:

**Power Subsystem:**
- Municipal government → Police department (resource provision, direction)
- Community A leaders → Municipal government (electoral influence)
- Business owners → Municipal government (financial support, lobbying)

**Community Division Subsystem:**
- Media outlets → Community perception (reinforcing stereotypes)
- Neighborhood associations → Segregated activities and advocacy
- Youth gangs → Intercommunity tension (territorial disputes)

**Potential Peace Subsystem:**
- Religious institutions ↔ Religious institutions (interfaith dialogue)
- School system → Youth from both communities (shared education)
- Civil society organizations → Cross-community initiatives

**Leverage Points:**
1. Interfaith council (bridging divided communities)
2. School-based youth programs (breaking intergenerational cycles)
3. Inclusive municipal planning processes (addressing structural inequities)
4. Police-community forums (rebuilding trust and accountability)
5. Cross-community business association (creating economic interdependence)

## Common Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Stakeholder omission**: Continually ask "who else might be affected or have influence?"
2. **Static mapping**: Update the map regularly as the conflict context evolves
3. **Oversimplification**: Acknowledge complexities within stakeholder groups
4. **Assumption projection**: Verify stakeholder attributes through direct engagement
5. **Relationship bias**: Seek multiple perspectives on how stakeholders relate
6. **Analysis paralysis**: Balance thoroughness with practicality and usability
7. **Insufficient action**: Move from mapping to strategy development and intervention

## Next Steps After Mapping

1. **Stakeholder engagement planning**: Develop strategies for engaging different stakeholders
2. **Coalition building**: Identify opportunities to strengthen peace-oriented relationships
3. **Intervention design**: Create targeted interventions based on identified leverage points
4. **Monitoring system**: Track changes in stakeholder dynamics and relationships over time
5. **Capacity development**: Address gaps in stakeholder capabilities for constructive engagement
6. **Communication strategy**: Develop messaging appropriate to different stakeholders
7. **Ongoing analysis**: Regularly update the map as the conflict system evolves
