## PART 3: RESOURCE VALUATION GUIDELINES

### Valuing Non-Financial Contributions

To create meaningful sustainability calculations, communities must fairly value non-financial contributions. This section provides practical guidance for consistent valuation.

#### Volunteer Time

**Standard Approach**:
Value volunteer time based on local equivalents for similar paid work.

**Calculation Options**:

- Community Mediator (8 hours/month): $___
- Peace Event Organization (12 hours/event): $___
- Administrative Support (2 hours/week): $___

#### Meeting Spaces and Facilities

**Standard Approach**:
Value based on local rental costs for similar spaces.

**Calculation Options**:
- **Market Rate Method**: What would similar space rental cost?
- **Utility Cost Method**: What are the power, water, cleaning costs?
- **Opportunity Cost Method**: What income is foregone by providing space?

**Example Valuations**:
- Community Hall (per day): $___
- Religious Facility (per meeting): $___
- School Classroom (per session): $___
- Outdoor Meeting Area (per gathering): $___

#### Transportation and Equipment

## Conclusion

Financial sustainability represents a journey rather than a destination. The Peace Fund Sustainability Calculator provides communities with practical tools to navigate this journey step by step, building greater self-reliance while maintaining effective peacebuilding activities. By systematically planning, tracking, and adjusting resource mobilization strategies, communities can reduce external dependency while strengthening local ownership and commitment to peace.

Each context will require adaptation of these tools, but the fundamental principles remain consistent: clear assessment, realistic planning, regular monitoring, and thoughtful adjustment. The calculator helps make what might seem an overwhelming transition more manageable through concrete, incremental steps.

The ultimate goal is not simply financial self-sufficiency, but rather the development of resilient, community-owned peace initiatives that can sustain their impact over time. When communities mobilize their own resources for peace, they simultaneously strengthen their commitment to and ownership of peace processes, creating foundations for lasting positive change.
