# Leverage Point Identification Matrix

## Introduction

Leverage points are places within complex conflict systems where small, well-focused interventions can produce significant changes in system behavior. This matrix provides a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential leverage points for more effective peacebuilding interventions.

Based on Donella Meadows' pioneering work on systems leverage points and adapted specifically for conflict contexts, this tool helps practitioners move beyond addressing symptoms to transforming the underlying systems that drive conflicts. By systematically evaluating potential intervention points, peacebuilders can direct limited resources toward actions with the greatest potential for sustainable impact.

## Leverage Point Hierarchy

Leverage points vary in their transformative potential, with deeper system changes generally offering more fundamental and lasting impacts. This hierarchy organizes leverage points from most powerful (paradigm shifts) to least powerful (parameter adjustments), though all types have their appropriate applications:

### 1. Paradigms and Worldviews (Transformational)
Interventions that shift the basic assumptions, beliefs, and values through which people understand conflict.

### 2. System Purpose and Goals (Directional)
Interventions that reorient the aims and objectives of conflict systems.

### 3. System Structure and Design (Architectural)
Interventions that reorganize the relationships, rules, and power dynamics within conflict systems.

### 4. Feedback Mechanisms (Regulatory)
Interventions that adjust how information flows and influences behavior within the system.

### 5. Rules and Constraints (Operational)
Interventions that modify the formal and informal rules governing conflict behavior.

### 6. Information Flows (Informational)
Interventions that change what information is available to whom and how it is interpreted.

### 7. Material Parameters (Tactical)
Interventions that adjust specific resources, numbers, or physical factors within the conflict.

## Leverage Point Identification Process

### Step 1: Identify Potential Leverage Points
Using system mapping tools (e.g., Causal Loop Diagrams, Stock and Flow Analysis), identify areas where intervention might significantly influence system behavior. For each potential leverage point, document:

- **Name**: Clear, specific descriptor of the leverage point
- **Location**: Where in the system this point exists
- **Type**: Classification according to the leverage point hierarchy
- **Current State**: Description of how this aspect of the system currently functions
- **Desired State**: Vision of how this aspect would function in a more peaceful system

### Step 2: Analyze Impact Potential
For each potential leverage point, evaluate:

- **Influence Scope**: How many other system elements would be affected by changes at this point
- **Directionality**: Whether effects would be unidirectional or create ripple effects throughout the system
- **Time Horizon**: How quickly effects might manifest (short, medium, or long-term)
- **Sustainability**: Likelihood that changes would be self-reinforcing rather than temporary

### Step 3: Assess Feasibility
Evaluate the practical considerations for intervention:

- **Access**: How readily this point can be influenced by your organization
- **Resource Requirements**: What would be needed to create change at this point
- **Stakeholder Support**: Level of buy-in from key actors for intervention at this point
- **Risk Level**: Potential for unintended consequences or backlash

### Step 4: Prioritize Leverage Points
Using the analysis from Steps 2 and 3, prioritize leverage points based on:

- **Impact-to-Effort Ratio**: Balance of potential influence against required resources
- **Strategic Alignment**: Fit with organizational capabilities and mission
- **Sequencing Logic**: Which points might need to be addressed before others
- **Complementarity**: How interventions at different points might reinforce each other

### Step 5: Design Interventions
For prioritized leverage points, develop specific intervention strategies:

- **Intervention Approach**: Concrete actions to influence the leverage point
- **Key Actors**: Who needs to be involved in implementation
- **Timeline**: Sequence and timing of activities
- **Success Indicators**: How to measure whether the intervention is creating desired change

## Common Leverage Points in Conflict Systems

### Paradigm-Level Leverage Points
- **Identity Narratives**: How groups understand themselves in relation to others
- **Historical Memory**: How past conflicts are interpreted and remembered
- **Justice Concepts**: What constitutes fair treatment and legitimate grievance
- **Security Definitions**: What creates a sense of safety and threat

### Purpose-Level Leverage Points
- **Shared Visions**: Articulation of common futures that transcend divisions
- **Peace Agreement Goals**: Stated aims of formal conflict resolution processes
- **Development Priorities**: What outcomes are valued in post-conflict recovery
- **Institutional Mandates**: Formal purposes of governance organizations

### Structure-Level Leverage Points
- **Power-Sharing Arrangements**: How decision-making authority is distributed
- **Resource Allocation Systems**: Mechanisms determining who gets what
- **Governance Architecture**: Design of institutions managing conflict-prone issues
- **Social Network Connections**: Relationships across conflict divides

### Feedback-Level Leverage Points
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: How actions are monitored and evaluated
- **Constituent Pressures**: How communities influence leadership decisions
- **Market Signals**: How economic incentives shape conflict-related choices
- **Success Metrics**: What outcomes are measured and valued

### Rules-Level Leverage Points
- **Legal Frameworks**: Formal laws governing conflict-related behaviors
- **Social Norms**: Informal expectations about appropriate conduct
- **Operational Procedures**: How organizations implement broader policies
- **Incentive Structures**: What behaviors are rewarded or punished

### Information-Level Leverage Points
- **Conflict Early Warning**: What data is collected about emerging tensions
- **Media Narratives**: How conflicts are portrayed and interpreted publicly
- **Knowledge Access**: Who has information about resources, rights, and options
- **Decision-Making Inputs**: What factors are considered in policy choices

### Parameter-Level Leverage Points
- **Security Force Numbers**: Size and composition of military/police
- **Resource Quantities**: Amount of contested resources available
- **Budget Allocations**: Financial resources directed to different priorities
- **Physical Infrastructure**: Material systems supporting communities

## Implementation Considerations

### Complementary Interventions
Design multi-level approaches that combine:
- High-impact but slow-moving paradigm interventions
- Medium-impact structural changes
- Immediate parameter adjustments to create space for deeper work

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Include diverse perspectives in identifying leverage points
- Consider whose interests are served by current system configurations
- Engage those who can influence or might resist changes at leverage points

### Complexity Awareness
- Recognize that interventions may have unintended consequences
- Design adaptive approaches that can adjust to system responses
- Build in regular reassessment of leverage point effectiveness

### Context Sensitivity
- Adapt the framework to match local conflict dynamics
- Consider cultural factors in how leverage points function
- Respect indigenous knowledge about system functioning

## Conclusion

The Leverage Point Identification Matrix provides a structured approach to finding the most promising intervention points within complex conflict systems. By systematically analyzing where limited resources might create maximum positive impact, practitioners can design more effective, sustainable peacebuilding strategies.

Remember that higher-level leverage points (paradigms, purposes, structures) generally offer more transformative potential but may require more time and face greater resistance. Lower-level points (parameters, information flows) can show quicker results but may address symptoms rather than causes. The most effective approaches often combine interventions at multiple levels, creating synergies that can shift seemingly intractable conflicts toward sustainable peace.
