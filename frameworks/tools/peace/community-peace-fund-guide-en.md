# Community Peace Fund Establishment Guide

## Introduction

Peace initiatives often struggle with sustainable funding, particularly in low-resource regions where external donors are limited and conventional financing mechanisms may be inaccessible. The Community Peace Fund (CPF) model addresses this challenge by enabling communities to pool, manage, and allocate their own resources for peacebuilding activities. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for establishing and maintaining community-managed peace funds that can operate even in contexts with minimal external support.

### Purpose of This Guide

This guide helps communities and facilitators to:
- Establish transparent, community-owned financing mechanisms for peace initiatives
- Design culturally appropriate fund governance adapted to local contexts
- Develop practical management systems that work in low-literacy settings
- Create sustainable funding sources that reduce dependency on external donors
- Build financial management capacity for long-term peace infrastructure

### Who Should Use This Guide

- Community leaders and peace committee members
- Civil society organizations working on peacebuilding
- Local government representatives interested in supporting peace initiatives
- Traditional and religious leaders engaged in conflict resolution
- Women's groups and youth organizations active in peace work

## PART I: UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITY PEACE FUNDS

### What is a Community Peace Fund?

A Community Peace Fund is a locally managed financial mechanism that pools resources from community members and, when available, external sources to support peacebuilding activities. Unlike conventional donor funding, CPFs emphasize community ownership, transparent local governance, and sustainable resource mobilization appropriate to the context.

### Core Principles of Community Peace Funds

1. **Community Ownership**: The fund is governed, contributed to, and managed by community members.

2. **Transparent Governance**: Decision-making processes and financial management are visible and accountable to all community members.

3. **Inclusive Participation**: Fund governance includes diverse community representatives, especially women, youth, and marginalized groups.

4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: Fund structures adapt to existing community practices and values rather than imposing external models.

5. **Sustainable Design**: The fund balances immediate peacebuilding needs with long-term resource sustainability.

6. **Conflict Sensitivity**: Fund operations avoid reinforcing existing tensions or creating new conflicts.

### Types of Community Peace Funds

Community Peace Funds can take several forms depending on local needs and capacities:

#### 1. Village Peace Funds
Small-scale funds managed at the village level, typically supporting local mediation, dialogue, and reconciliation activities. These funds often operate with minimal written documentation and rely heavily on community trust systems.

**Example**: In South Sudan, the Mundri Peace Committee established a village fund where community members contributed small amounts monthly, enabling rapid response to emerging conflicts between farmers and cattle herders.

#### 2. Networked Peace Funds
Connected funds across multiple communities that pool resources for addressing broader peace challenges, often with a coordinating committee and more formalized management.

**Example**: The Women's Peace Hut Network in Liberia connects multiple community-level funds to address cross-border conflicts and enable knowledge sharing between communities.

#### 3. Revolving Peace Funds
Funds that provide recoverable grants or zero-interest loans for peace-positive economic initiatives, with repayments maintaining the fund for future activities.

**Example**: In Colombia, post-conflict communities established revolving funds that supported joint business ventures between former adversaries, with profits partially reinvested in community peace activities.

#### 4. Resource-Based Peace Funds
Funds linked to natural resource management that allocate a percentage of resource revenues to peacebuilding activities across community lines.

**Example**: In the Philippines, the Mindanao Trust Fund allocates a portion of resource development revenues to support peace initiatives in conflict-affected communities.

## PART II: ESTABLISHING YOUR COMMUNITY PEACE FUND

### STEP 1: Conduct a Resource Mapping Assessment

Before establishing a CPF, assess your community's resource landscape:

#### A. Identify Existing Resources
- **Financial Resources**: Evaluate current sources of community income and savings
- **Physical Resources**: Catalog community spaces, tools, and materials that can support peace activities
- **Human Resources**: Map skills, knowledge, and experience available in the community
- **Social Resources**: Document social networks, traditional institutions, and community practices that can be leveraged

#### B. Analyze Resource Flow Patterns
- How do resources typically flow through the community?
- What existing saving or resource-pooling practices exist?
- Are there seasonal variations in resource availability?
- Which community members control different types of resources?

#### C. Assess Community Confidence
- How comfortable are community members with collective financial management?
- What existing mechanisms build trust in resource sharing?
- What past experiences with community funds have succeeded or failed?

## PART III: CASE STUDIES AND ADAPTATIONS

### Case Study 1: Women's Peace Huts in Liberia

Following Liberia's civil war, women established Peace Huts across the country to resolve conflicts and prevent violence. Each Peace Hut maintains a small community fund through:

- Weekly contributions from women's group members (25-50 Liberian dollars)
- Proceeds from community gardens maintained by members
- In-kind contributions of food and materials for mediation sessions
- Rotating volunteer time for Peace Hut staffing

Fund operations feature:
- Monthly transparent reporting during community meetings
- Pictorial records maintained by elected treasurers
- Verification of fund use by community elders
- Fixed allocations for different types of peace activities

**Results**: Peace Huts have sustainably operated for over 15 years, resolving hundreds of local conflicts with minimal external support. The fund model has been replicated in over 40 communities across Liberia.

### Case Study 2: South Sudan Cattle Camp Peace Funds

In pastoralist communities of South Sudan, traditional cattle camps established peace funds to address recurrent conflicts over grazing rights and cattle raiding. These funds operate through:

- Contributions of one cow per season from each family group
- Allocation of milk products from designated "peace cattle"
- Labor contributions for protection and conflict mediation
- Designation of grazing areas for "peace herd" maintenance

Fund governance includes:
- Elder oversight combined with youth implementation
- Seasonal fund replenishment aligned with migration patterns
- Traditional accountability rituals during camp gatherings
- Conflict resolution services exchanged between neighboring camps

**Results**: Where implemented, these funds reduced cattle raids by over 60% and established sustainable cross-camp peace mechanisms that function with zero external funding.

### Case Study 3: Colombia's Victim-Led Reconciliation Funds

In post-conflict Colombia, communities established reconciliation funds managed by conflict victims to support healing and reintegration. These funds feature:

- Equal contributions from victims and former combatants
- Percentage allocations from productive projects
- Municipal matching contributions
- Memory and reconciliation events with donation components

Fund governance emphasizes:
- Equal representation of all conflict-affected groups
- Transparent criteria prioritizing reconciliation impacts
- Public accountability sessions in community squares
- Graduated fund growth as trust develops

**Results**: These funds have supported over 200 reconciliation initiatives, gradually transitioning from external seed funding to 80% local resources within three years.

### Adapting to Specific Contexts

#### High-Conflict Environments
- Emphasize neutral fund governance with cross-group representation
- Implement additional security measures for fund resources
- Consider external neutral custodianship during acute conflict
- Prioritize low-visibility operations when needed

#### Very Low-Resource Settings
- Focus on in-kind and labor contributions rather than cash

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: How much money do we need to start a Community Peace Fund?
A: Community Peace Funds can start with minimal financial resources. The key is establishing the governance systems and beginning with whatever resources—financial or non-financial—the community can mobilize. Some successful funds began with as little as $50 USD equivalent, while others started entirely with in-kind contributions before adding financial components.

#### Q: Who should control the fund resources?
A: Fund resources should be managed by a diverse, representative committee rather than individuals. Many successful funds use dual-control mechanisms where at least two people must approve any resource use, combined with regular community verification.

#### Q: How do we prevent existing conflicts from affecting the fund?
A: Design the fund governance to intentionally cross conflict lines, with representation from all community sectors. Establish clear, neutral criteria for resource allocation and maintain transparent operations visible to all community members. Consider trusted third-party involvement during initial phases if tensions are high.

#### Q: How can we involve external donors without creating dependency?
A: Establish clear fund governance before seeking external support. Consider matching models where external funds supplement rather than replace community contributions. Develop phase-out plans for any external support from the beginning, with transparent timelines shared with all stakeholders.

#### Q: How do we measure the fund's impact on peace?
A: Combine simple quantitative metrics (number of conflicts addressed, participation levels, resource mobilization) with qualitative approaches (peace impact stories, community perception surveys, joint activities across conflict lines). Focus on changes in relationships and community cohesion alongside more tangible outcomes.

## Conclusion

Community Peace Funds represent a powerful approach to sustainable peacebuilding financing in low-resource contexts. By mobilizing and managing local resources through transparent, inclusive mechanisms, communities can reduce dependency on external support while building lasting peace infrastructure. Each fund will develop uniquely according to local context and needs, but the core principles of community ownership, transparent governance, and sustainable resource mobilization remain constant. As your fund develops, continue learning and adapting while sharing your experiences with others embarking on similar journeys.

## Appendix D: Alternative Contribution Systems

### D-1: Time Banking System

**Overview:**
The Time Banking system allows community members to contribute their time and skills to peace activities, earning "time credits" that can be exchanged for support when needed. This system is particularly valuable in extremely resource-constrained contexts where monetary contributions are difficult.

**Key Components:**
1. **Time Credit Unit:** One hour of service equals one time credit
2. **Skill Inventory:** Community-wide mapping of available skills
3. **Service Exchange Board:** Public display where needs and offerings are posted
4. **Time Credit Ledger:** Record of credits earned and spent
5. **Peace Service Priority List:** Activities that specifically earn peace-related credits

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Conduct community-wide skill and need mapping
2. Establish time credit governance committee
3. Create simple physical or digital recording system
4. Launch with high-visibility peace services
5. Conduct regular trading sessions or posting updates
6. Hold periodic community reviews of system fairness

**Example Activities:**
* Mediating a community dispute (3 credits)
* Providing venue for peace dialogue (2 credits)
* Facilitating youth peace education (2 credits per hour)
* Serving as neutral observer (1 credit per hour)
* Creating peace messaging materials (2 credits)

**Success Factors:**
* Transparent governance with diverse representation
* Regular public accounting of credits
* Balance between peace-specific and general community services
* Mechanism to prevent system domination by certain individuals
* Integration with existing traditional exchange practices

### D-2: Resource-Based Contribution System

**Overview:**
This system links peace fund contributions to the management of community resources, creating sustainable funding streams from shared resources while simultaneously addressing resource-based conflict triggers.

**Resource Integration Models:**
1. **Harvest Peace Portion:** A small portion of communal harvests designated for peace fund
2. **Resource User Fees:** Nominal fees from using community resources allocated to peace
3. **Peace Management Zones:** Specific areas whose productivity supports peace activities
4. **Conflict Resource Premium:** Additional contribution from high-conflict potential resources

**Implementation Considerations:**
* Establish clear, transparent connection between resource and peace
* Ensure contribution level is sustainable and not burdensome
* Create inclusive management connecting resource users and peace stakeholders
* Develop specific resource-peace linkages in contribution messaging
* Prioritize conflict-prevention use of funds for resource-related tensions

**Example Applications:**
* **Water Sources:** Small user fee directly supporting water-conflict mediation
* **Grazing Lands:** Designated "peace cattle" whose products support fund
* **Community Forests:** Percentage of sustainable harvest supporting peace
* **Market Spaces:** Minimal peace-contribution integrated into market fees
* **Transport Routes:** Token contribution from transporters for route security

### D-3: Celebration and Ceremony Contribution System

**Overview:**
This system integrates peace fund contributions into community celebrations, ceremonies, and cultural events, creating natural and culturally-resonant opportunities for resource mobilization.

**Integration Approaches:**
1. **Peace Blessing Component:** Dedicated ritual within ceremonies for peace contributions
2. **Celebration Peace Pledge:** Expected contribution during community celebrations
3. **Ceremony Peace Service:** In-kind services for ceremonies that generate peace fund support
4. **Gratitude Offerings:** Portion of ceremony gifts designated for community peace
5. **Peace Recognition Moments:** Special acknowledgment of peace contributors during events

**Cultural Considerations:**
* Respect traditional ceremony integrity while creating space for peace
* Ensure contributions feel voluntary rather than obligatory
* Create visible connection between ceremony success and community peace
* Design culturally appropriate recognition for contributors
* Maintain celebration spirit while addressing serious peace needs

**Example Applications:**
* Weddings: Small percentage of gifts contributed to peace fund
* Harvest Festivals: Peace fund contribution integrated into thanksgiving
* Religious Ceremonies: Peace offering component added to traditional practices
* Naming Ceremonies: Peace blessing gift as part of child's community welcome
* Year-End Celebrations: Peace gratitude practice with practical contribution

### D-4: Hybrid Physical-Digital Contribution System

**Overview:**
For communities with partial connectivity and mixed technology access, this hybrid system combines physical and digital tools to maximize participation while building toward more efficient systems.

**System Components:**
1. **SMS Contribution Tracking:** Simple text message receipt and record system
2. **Paper Backup Documentation:** Physical records maintained alongside digital
3. **QR-Code Transaction Sheets:** Printable codes that connect to digital records when available
4. **Intermittent Synchronization:** Regular process to align physical and digital records
5. **Accessible Verification Mechanisms:** Multiple ways to check contribution status

**Implementation Approaches:**
* Train diverse community members in both physical and digital methods
