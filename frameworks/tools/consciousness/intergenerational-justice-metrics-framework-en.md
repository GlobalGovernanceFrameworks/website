**Framework**: Consciousness & Inner Development  
**Type**: Metrics and Accountability Tool  
**Audience**: Policy Analysts, Sustainability Officers, Youth Advocates, Community Planners, Future Generation Ombudspersons, Governance Assessment Teams  

## Overview

The Intergenerational Justice Metrics Framework provides comprehensive measurement tools for evaluating how current governance decisions and policies impact future generations. Moving beyond traditional policy analysis that focuses primarily on immediate outcomes, this framework integrates long-term thinking, youth voice, elder wisdom, and future generation advocacy into systematic accountability mechanisms. The framework recognizes that true justice requires considering the welfare of those not yet born and ensuring that current decisions enhance rather than diminish opportunities for future community flourishing.

**Purpose**: Establish systematic measurement and accountability for intergenerational impacts of governance decisions while empowering youth voice, honoring elder wisdom, and creating institutional mechanisms for protecting future generation interests in current decision-making.

**Scope**: Comprehensive metrics framework covering environmental sustainability, economic justice, social cohesion, cultural preservation, educational opportunity, democratic participation, and institutional resilience, with specific tools for impact assessment, youth engagement, and long-term accountability across seven generations.

**Application Format**: Flexible measurement system enabling integration into policy development, budget planning, community assessment, and governance accountability, with adaptable indicators for different community contexts and cultural approaches to intergenerational responsibility.
