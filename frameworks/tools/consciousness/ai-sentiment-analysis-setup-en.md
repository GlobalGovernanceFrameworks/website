        sentiment_logits = self.sentiment_head(pooled_output)
        adversarial_logits = self.adversarial_head(pooled_output)
        
        if return_embeddings:
            return sentiment_logits, adversarial_logits, pooled_output
        return sentiment_logits, adversarial_logits

class FairnessLoss(nn.Module):

**Cultural Sensitivity Issues**:

*Common Problems*:
- Sentiment analysis not working well for specific cultural groups
- Community feeling that their communication styles are misunderstood
- Concerns about cultural appropriation or insensitive technology

*Resolution Strategies*:
- Engage cultural community leaders in solution development
- Invest in culturally-specific training data and model adaptation
- Provide cultural competency training for technical team
- Consider alternative approaches that better honor cultural communication styles
- Implement community veto power over culturally inappropriate applications

### Scaling and Resource Challenges

**Infrastructure Scaling**:

```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment for scaled sentiment analysis
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sentiment-analyzer
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sentiment-analyzer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sentiment-analyzer
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sentiment-analyzer
        image: community/sentiment-analyzer:v1.2
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1000m"
          limits:
            memory: "4Gi"
            cpu: "2000m"
        env:
        - name: MODEL_CACHE_SIZE
          value: "1000"
        - name: PRIVACY_LEVEL
          value: "high"
        - name: BIAS_CHECKING_ENABLED
          value: "true"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 60
          periodSeconds: 30
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
