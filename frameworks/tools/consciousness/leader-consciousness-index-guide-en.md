**Scope**: Comprehensive assessment framework covering individual consciousness development, leadership effectiveness, community impact, cultural competence, ethical decision-making, and systems thinking, with specific applications for selection, development, and accountability of leaders in conscious governance contexts.

**Application Format**: Multi-modal assessment system enabling self-directed development, peer evaluation, community feedback, professional assessment, and longitudinal tracking of leadership consciousness growth over time.
