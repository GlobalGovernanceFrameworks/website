## Implementation Approaches

| Institution Type | Recommended Approach | Timeline | Key Considerations |
|------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Global Systemically Important Bank | Phased integration starting with innovation hub | 18-24 months | Regulatory coordination across multiple jurisdictions |
| Regional/Community Bank | Hearts account offering paired with local implementation | 9-12 months | Community engagement and validator network development |
| Central Bank | Regulatory sandbox followed by CBDC integration exploration | 24-36 months | Monetary policy implications and financial stability |
| Investment Firm | Hearts-linked ESG products with impact measurement | 6-12 months | Investor education and performance metrics alignment |
| Microfinance Institution | Hearts recognition for capacity building and community development | 3-6 months | Last-mile implementation and offline access |

## Implementation Milestones

The guide outlines key implementation milestones:

1. **Strategic Assessment**: Evaluate organizational readiness and business case (1-2 months)
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Secure executive sponsorship and cross-functional buy-in (1-2 months)
3. **Technical Planning**: Develop integration architecture and timeline (2-3 months)
4. **Regulatory Engagement**: Consult with relevant authorities and ensure compliance (ongoing)
5. **Pilot Development**: Create limited-scope implementation for testing (3-4 months)
