## Introduction

The Community Well-Being Index provides a comprehensive framework for measuring, tracking, and enhancing community flourishing across multiple dimensions. It moves beyond narrow economic metrics to capture the diverse factors that contribute to genuine well-being, including social connections, ecological relationships, cultural vitality, and governance participation.

This tool supports implementation across the Global Governance Framework by establishing consistent, culturally adaptable metrics that enable communities to define, measure, and improve well-being on their own terms. The index combines universal core dimensions with framework-specific modules, allowing for both standardized comparison and context-specific application while centering community self-determination in defining success.

The Community Well-Being Index provides a flexible, participatory framework for measuring what matters most for genuine community flourishing. By combining universal dimensions with framework-specific modules, it enables both standardized comparison and context-appropriate application while centering community self-determination.

When implemented through collaborative processes, the index becomes more than a measurement tool—it serves as a catalyst for community reflection, priority-setting, and collective action. Through regular assessment cycles, communities can track progress, adapt interventions, and celebrate improvements as they work toward truly holistic well-being.
