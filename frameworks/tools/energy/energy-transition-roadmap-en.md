# Energy Transition Roadmap Template

## Introduction

The **Energy Transition Roadmap Template** is a practical tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to guide stakeholders in planning and implementing the transition to clean, sustainable energy systems. This template supports policymakers, regional authorities, businesses, and civil society organizations (CSOs) in developing actionable roadmaps to achieve the Framework’s energy transition goals, including 60% renewable energy by 2035 and 100% by 2050, while ensuring universal clean energy access, resilience, and equitable outcomes.

The template aligns with the Framework’s principles of sustainability, equity, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, integrating the four pillars: Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology. It provides a structured approach to map current energy systems, set transition targets, identify interventions, and monitor progress, fostering coordination across governance levels and sectors.

### Objectives
- Assess current energy systems and their alignment with Framework goals.
- Set clear, science-based targets for renewable energy adoption and fossil fuel phase-out.
- Identify interventions (e.g., renewable energy deployment, grid modernization) to achieve transition goals.
- Engage stakeholders to ensure equitable and inclusive planning.
- Monitor and evaluate progress using standardized metrics.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and energy planners
- Businesses in the energy sector (e.g., renewable energy firms, utilities)
- CSOs advocating for clean energy and just transitions
- Communities affected by energy transitions

## Energy Transition Roadmap

### 1. Current Energy System Assessment
Document the current energy mix, infrastructure, and policies to establish a baseline.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Energy Mix** | E.g., 50% coal, 20% natural gas, 20% renewables, 10% nuclear |
| **Infrastructure** | E.g., Aging coal plants, limited grid storage, 5,000 MW solar capacity |
| **Key Policies** | E.g., Renewable energy mandate (20% by 2025), fossil fuel subsidies |
| **Emissions Profile** | E.g., 500 MtCO2e from energy sector (40% of national emissions) |
| **Access and Equity** | E.g., 90% energy access, rural areas underserved |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (renewable target below 60% by 2035) |

**Instructions**: 
- Use data from national energy reports or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Identify gaps (e.g., low renewable share, fossil fuel dependence) and equity issues (e.g., underserved communities).

**Example**: Country X’s energy mix is 50% coal, 20% renewables, with aging infrastructure and 90% access. Its 20% renewable target by 2025 falls short of the Framework’s 60% by 2035, requiring accelerated action.

### 2. Transition Targets
Set specific, science-based targets for the energy transition, aligned with Framework milestones.

| **Target** | **Timeline** | **Description** |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Renewable Energy Share | 2035 | E.g., Achieve 60% renewable energy in electricity mix |
| Fossil Fuel Phase-Out | 2040 | E.g., Phase out coal-fired power plants |
| Energy Access | 2030 | E.g., Achieve 100% clean energy access, prioritizing rural areas |
| Emissions Reduction | 2035 | E.g., Reduce energy sector emissions by 50% from 2020 levels |
| Grid Resilience | 2035 | E.g., Upgrade grid to support 80% variable renewables |

**Instructions**: 
- Align targets with Framework goals (e.g., 60% renewable energy by 2035, 100% by 2050).
- Ensure equity considerations (e.g., prioritize access for underserved communities).
- Validate targets with stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: Country X targets 60% renewable energy by 2035, coal phase-out by 2040, and 100% energy access by 2030, with stakeholder input from rural communities and renewable energy firms.

### 3. Transition Interventions
Outline specific interventions to achieve transition targets, including renewable energy deployment, infrastructure upgrades, and just transition measures.

#### 3.1 Renewable Energy Deployment
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Technologies** | E.g., Solar, wind, green hydrogen |
| **Capacity Goals** | E.g., Add 10,000 MW solar, 5,000 MW wind by 2035 |
| **Projects** | E.g., 50 community solar farms, 20 offshore wind farms |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2026-2035, 2,000 MW added annually |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., Framework finance, private investment |

**Example**: Country X will deploy 10,000 MW of solar and 5,000 MW of wind by 2035, with 50 community solar farms funded by Framework grants and private investment.

#### 3.2 Infrastructure Upgrades
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Infrastructure Needs** | E.g., Grid storage, smart grids, EV charging networks |
| **Projects** | E.g., 1,000 MW battery storage, 500 EV charging stations |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2027-2035, storage operational by 2030 |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., National budget, green bonds |

**Example**: Country X will install 1,000 MW of battery storage by 2030 and 500 EV charging stations by 2035, funded by green bonds and national budgets.

#### 3.3 Just Transition Measures
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Target Group** | E.g., 20,000 coal workers, 5 rural communities |
