# Multi-level Governance Coordination Guide

## Introduction

The **Multi-level Governance Coordination Guide** is a critical tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to facilitate effective coordination across global, regional, and national governance levels to achieve the Framework’s goals: net-zero emissions by 2050, universal clean energy access, and climate resilience for vulnerable communities. This guide supports policymakers, regional authorities, and National Implementation Units in aligning policies, resources, and actions across the Framework’s governance structures—Global Oversight Body, Regional Climate & Energy Governance Hubs, and National Implementation Units—while integrating the four pillars: Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology.

The guide emphasizes cooperation, adaptability, and science-based decision-making, ensuring that multi-level governance is cohesive, inclusive, and responsive to local and global needs. It provides practical strategies, templates, and metrics to streamline communication, resolve conflicts, and share resources, fostering accountability and synergy across governance levels.

- Facilitate resource sharing (e.g., climate finance, technical expertise) to support Framework implementation.
- Ensure inclusive stakeholder participation in multi-level coordination processes.
- Resolve conflicts and leverage synergies between governance levels.
- Monitor and evaluate coordination outcomes to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and governance bodies
- Global Oversight Body representatives
- Civil society organizations (CSOs) advocating for governance coherence
- Businesses engaged in cross-border climate initiatives

## Multi-level Governance Coordination Guide

### 1. Governance Levels and Roles
Understand the roles and responsibilities of each governance level within the Framework to ensure effective coordination.

| **Governance Level** | **Role** | **Key Responsibilities** |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Global Oversight Body** | Sets global targets and coordinates compliance | - Develop global carbon budgets (e.g., 400 GtCO2 for 1.5°C)<br>- Allocate climate finance<br>- Monitor compliance via ICMS |
| **Regional Climate & Energy Governance Hubs** | Translate global targets into regional strategies | - Develop regional climate plans (e.g., 60% renewable energy by 2035)<br>- Facilitate cross-border projects<br>- Provide technical and financial support |
| **National Implementation Units** | Implement domestic policies aligned with Framework | - Draft national legislation (e.g., net-zero by 2050)<br>- Monitor and report emissions<br>- Implement just transition programs |

**Instructions**: 
- Map your organization’s role within these levels (e.g., National Implementation Unit coordinating with a Regional Hub).
- Identify points of interaction (e.g., reporting to Global Oversight Body, collaborating with Regional Hubs).

**Example**: Country X’s National Implementation Unit submits annual emissions reports to the Global Oversight Body and collaborates with the Regional Hub for Southeast Asia to access climate finance for renewable energy projects.

### 2. Coordination Mapping
Map key actors and their coordination roles to establish clear communication and collaboration pathways.

| **Governance Level** | **Actor/Organization** | **Coordination Role** | **Contact Point** |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Global | E.g., Global Oversight Body | Set targets, monitor compliance | oversight@globalgovernanceframework.org |
| Regional | E.g., Southeast Asia Regional Hub | Coordinate regional renewable energy plans | regionalhub@globalgovernanceframework.org |
| National | E.g., Country X National Implementation Unit | Implement carbon pricing, report progress | climateunit@gov.x |
| Stakeholder | E.g., CSO Coalition | Advocate for just transition policies | advocacy@cso.org |

**Instructions**: 
- List actors relevant to your context, including stakeholders (e.g., businesses, CSOs) engaged via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Define their coordination roles (e.g., policy alignment, resource sharing).
- Include contact points to facilitate communication.

**Example**: The Southeast Asia Regional Hub coordinates a shared renewable energy grid plan, liaising with Country X’s National Implementation Unit and a CSO coalition advocating for equitable energy access.

### 3. Coordination Mechanisms
Implement mechanisms to foster communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution across governance levels.

| **Mechanism** | **Description** | **Use Case** | **Resources Needed** |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Joint Policy Forums** | Regular meetings to align policies across levels | E.g., Annual forum to harmonize carbon pricing | Facilitators, virtual platforms |
| **Data Sharing Platforms** | Centralized systems for emissions and policy data | E.g., Integrate national data with Data Commons | IT infrastructure, ICMS access |
| **Cross-Border Projects** | Collaborative initiatives (e.g., regional grids) | E.g., Regional solar grid connecting 3 countries | Funding, technical experts |
| **Conflict Resolution Panels** | Neutral bodies to address disputes | E.g., Resolve national-regional target conflicts | Mediators, legal advisors |
| **Capacity Building Workshops** | Training to enhance coordination skills | E.g., Workshop on ICMS reporting | Trainers, Framework tools |

**Instructions**: 
- Select mechanisms based on your coordination needs (e.g., data sharing for reporting, forums for policy alignment).
- Ensure stakeholder inclusion via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Use the [Climate Finance Access Navigator](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to fund initiatives.

**Example**: Country X hosts a joint policy forum with the Southeast Asia Regional Hub to align carbon pricing ($135/tCO2e by 2030), integrating national data into the Data Commons for transparency.

### 4. Coordination Action Plan
Develop a plan to implement coordination mechanisms, aligning with Framework milestones.

| **Action** | **Governance Levels Involved** | **Timeline** | **Responsible Party** | **Expected Outcome** |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| E.g., Establish joint policy forum | National, Regional | Q2 2026 | National Implementation Unit | Harmonized carbon pricing policies |
| E.g., Integrate data with Data Commons | National, Global | Q4 2026 | Climate Ministry | Transparent emissions reporting |
| E.g., Launch regional solar grid project | Regional, National | 2027-2030 | Regional Hub | 20% increase in renewable energy share |
| E.g., Train staff on ICMS reporting | National | Q3 2026 | Technical Team | 100% compliance with reporting standards |

**Instructions**: 
- Define actions to operationalize coordination mechanisms from Section 3.
- Align with Framework milestones (e.g., 60% renewable energy by 2035, 50% emissions reduction by 2035).
- Assign responsibilities and timelines, ensuring stakeholder input via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: By Q4 2026, Country X’s National Implementation Unit will integrate emissions data into the Data Commons, ensuring compliance with Global Oversight Body reporting standards, with CSO input on equity metrics.
