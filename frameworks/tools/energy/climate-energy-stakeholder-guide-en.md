# Stakeholder Implementation Guide for the Climate & Energy Governance Framework

## Introduction

This Stakeholder Implementation Guide is designed to empower businesses, civil society organizations (CSOs), and regional authorities to actively engage with and implement the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework**. The Framework provides a comprehensive roadmap for addressing the climate crisis and transitioning to clean, equitable energy systems. This guide translates its principles, structures, and mechanisms into practical steps tailored to the unique roles and opportunities of these stakeholder groups. By aligning with the Framework, stakeholders can contribute to global climate goals, drive local impact, and seize economic and social opportunities in the transition to a net-zero, climate-resilient future.

The guide emphasizes actionable strategies, clear responsibilities, and opportunities for collaboration across sectors. It draws on the Framework’s core pillars—climate mitigation, adaptation, energy transition, and innovation—and integrates its principles of sustainability, equity, science-based decision-making, cooperation, adaptability, and ethical governance. Whether you are a business seeking to decarbonize operations, a CSO advocating for climate justice, or a regional authority implementing local policies, this guide offers tools and pathways to align with the Framework’s vision.

## 2. Roles and Opportunities for Stakeholders

Each stakeholder group has distinct roles and opportunities within the Framework. This section outlines specific responsibilities and entry points for engagement.

### Businesses
Businesses, from multinational corporations to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are critical to achieving the Framework’s goals through investment, innovation, and operational changes.

#### Key Roles
- **Decarbonize Operations**: Align with sectoral decarbonization pathways (e.g., net-zero power generation by 2040, industry by 2050).
- **Invest in Clean Technologies**: Scale renewable energy, energy efficiency, green hydrogen, and circular economy solutions.
- **Implement Just Transition Practices**: Support workers and communities affected by fossil fuel phase-outs through retraining and economic diversification.
- **Influence Supply Chains**: Promote low-carbon practices among suppliers and partners.
- **Engage in Governance**: Participate in private sector advisory bodies and industry coalitions to shape climate policies.

#### Opportunities
- **Access to Climate Finance**: Leverage green bonds, tax incentives, and preferential financing for low-carbon investments.
- **Market Leadership**: Gain competitive advantages by adopting sustainable practices early.
- **Innovation Support**: Access R&D programs and technology transfer mechanisms for clean energy and climate solutions.
- **Reputation and Recognition**: Benefit from leadership recognition programs for exceeding climate commitments.

#### Practical Steps
1. **Conduct a Climate Impact Assessment**: Use Framework metrics (e.g., Scope 1-3 emissions reporting) to evaluate your carbon footprint and transition risks.
2. **Develop a Climate Transition Plan**: Set science-based targets aligned with 1.5°C pathways, including interim milestones (e.g., 50% emissions reduction by 2035).
3. **Integrate Internal Carbon Pricing**: Use shadow carbon prices to guide investment and operational decisions.
4. **Join Sectoral Partnerships**: Engage in Framework-supported coalitions (e.g., for steel, cement, or renewable energy) to share best practices and reduce costs.
5. **Report Transparently**: Disclose climate performance and just transition efforts through standardized Framework templates, ensuring third-party verification.
6. **Advocate for Policy Alignment**: Collaborate with Regional Hubs to support carbon pricing, subsidy reform, and clean energy mandates.

**Case Example**: Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan demonstrates how a multinational can integrate climate goals into core operations, reducing emissions by 65% in manufacturing while growing its sustainable product portfolio.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Benefit from peer learning through Framework-supported regional networks.
- **Resilience Building**: Access adaptation tools like early warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure standards.

#### Practical Steps
1. **Develop Regional Climate Plans**: Align with Framework targets (e.g., 60% renewable energy by 2035) while addressing regional priorities.
2. **Establish Multi-Stakeholder Forums**: Create platforms for businesses, CSOs, and communities to co-design policies.
3. **Implement Nature-Based Solutions**: Use Framework guidance to restore ecosystems (e.g., wetlands, forests) for carbon sequestration and resilience.
4. **Access Climate Finance**: Apply for funding through Regional Hubs for clean energy projects and adaptation measures.
5. **Monitor and Report**: Use Framework tools (e.g., Climate Policy Dashboard) to track progress and share data transparently.
6. **Foster Economic Diversification**: Support just transition programs for fossil fuel-dependent regions, leveraging Framework’s economic tools.

**Case Example**: The Pacific Resilience Program shows how regional authorities in small island states can pool resources to implement adaptation measures, offering a model for collaborative regional governance.
