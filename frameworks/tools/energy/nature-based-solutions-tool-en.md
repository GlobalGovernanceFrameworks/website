# Nature-based Solutions Assessment Tool

## Introduction

The **Nature-based Solutions Assessment Tool** is a key tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to guide stakeholders in evaluating, planning, and implementing nature-based solutions (NbS) to address climate change impacts, enhance resilience, and promote sustainable development. NbS, such as reforestation, wetland restoration, and urban green spaces, leverage ecosystems to deliver climate benefits while supporting biodiversity and community well-being. This tool supports policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and communities in integrating NbS into climate and energy strategies, aligning with the Framework’s goals of protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and enhancing ecosystem health.

The tool integrates the Framework’s principles of equity, sustainability, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, with a focus on the Climate Adaptation and Climate Mitigation pillars. It provides a structured approach to assess NbS potential, prioritize projects, engage stakeholders, and monitor outcomes, ensuring that solutions are inclusive, effective, and aligned with local and global needs.

### 1. NbS Potential Assessment
Evaluate climate risks, ecosystems, and community needs to identify opportunities for NbS.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Climate Risks** | E.g., Coastal flooding, drought, heatwaves |
| **Ecosystems Available** | E.g., Mangroves, forests, wetlands, urban green spaces |
| **Vulnerable Populations** | E.g., 200,000 coastal residents, 50,000 smallholder farmers |
| **Potential NbS** | E.g., Mangrove restoration, agroforestry, urban tree planting |
| **Current NbS Initiatives** | E.g., 5,000 hectares of mangroves restored, 10 urban green spaces |
| **Gaps and Opportunities** | E.g., Limited wetland restoration, opportunity for agroforestry expansion |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (NbS coverage below 75% community protection by 2035) |

**Instructions**: 
- Use climate risk assessments, biodiversity maps, or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for data.
- Identify ecosystems and populations suitable for NbS, focusing on vulnerable groups.
- Assess gaps relative to Framework targets (e.g., 75% vulnerable communities protected by 2035).

**Example**: Region Z faces coastal flooding and drought, with mangroves and wetlands available for restoration. Current initiatives cover 5,000 hectares of mangroves, but broader wetland restoration is needed to meet the 75% protection target by 2035.

### 2. NbS Project Prioritization
Prioritize NbS projects based on climate, biodiversity, and community benefits, aligned with Framework goals.

| **NbS Project** | **Target Area/Population** | **Benefits** | **Priority (High/Medium/Low)** |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| E.g., Mangrove Restoration | Coastal communities (200,000 residents) | Flood protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity | High |
| E.g., Agroforestry | Smallholder farmers (50,000) | Soil health, food security, carbon storage | High |
| E.g., Urban Green Spaces | Urban populations (100,000) | Heatwave mitigation, air quality | Medium |
| E.g., Wetland Restoration | Rural communities (20,000) | Water security, biodiversity | Medium |

**Instructions**: 
- List potential NbS projects, detailing their benefits (e.g., adaptation, mitigation, social).
- Assign priorities based on impact, feasibility, and equity (High for projects benefiting vulnerable groups).
- Validate priorities with stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy), ensuring Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities.

**Example**: Region Z prioritizes mangrove restoration for 200,000 coastal residents (high flood risk) and agroforestry for 50,000 farmers (food insecurity), with indigenous community input via FPIC.

### 3. NbS Implementation Plan
Outline specific NbS projects, including scope, funding, and community engagement.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Project** | E.g., Mangrove Restoration |
| **Target Area/Population** | E.g., 200,000 coastal residents across 10 communities |
| **Scope** | E.g., Restore 10,000 hectares of mangroves |
| **Climate Benefits** | E.g., Reduce flooding for 75% of residents, sequester 1 MtCO2e annually |
| **Biodiversity Benefits** | E.g., Protect 20 endangered species, enhance fish habitats |
| **Community Benefits** | E.g., 1,000 local jobs, improved fisheries |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2026-2035, 1,500 hectares annually |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., Framework finance, private investment, carbon credits |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | E.g., Community-led restoration, FPIC for indigenous groups |

**Instructions**: 
- Detail each prioritized NbS project, emphasizing climate, biodiversity, and social outcomes.
- Ensure equity by involving local communities and upholding FPIC.
- Identify funding via the [Climate Finance Access Navigator](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Align with the [Adaptation Planning Framework](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for adaptation-focused NbS.

**Example**: Region Z will restore 10,000 hectares of mangroves by 2035, reducing flooding for 200,000 residents and creating 1,000 jobs, funded by Framework grants and carbon credits, with community-led implementation.
