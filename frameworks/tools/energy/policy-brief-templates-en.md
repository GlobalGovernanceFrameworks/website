# Climate Policy Brief Templates

## Introduction

The **Climate Policy Brief Templates** are essential tools within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to help stakeholders craft concise, evidence-based policy briefs to communicate climate and energy strategies effectively. These templates enable policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and other actors to summarize key policies, engage stakeholders, and report progress, aligning with the Framework’s goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring universal clean energy access, and protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035.

The templates integrate the Framework’s principles of equity, transparency, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, covering all four pillars: Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology. They provide three distinct formats—Policy Overview Brief, Stakeholder Engagement Brief, and Implementation Update Brief—to address different communication needs, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and stakeholder inclusion.

### Objectives
- Summarize climate and energy policies for decision-makers and stakeholders.
- Communicate stakeholder engagement processes and outcomes to ensure transparency.
- Report implementation progress and challenges to maintain accountability.
- Align policy communication with Framework goals and pillars.
- Engage diverse audiences, including vulnerable communities, with clear and equitable messaging.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and communication teams
- CSOs advocating for climate action and equity
- Businesses aligning with climate policies
- General public, including vulnerable and indigenous communities

## Climate Policy Brief Templates

### Template 1: Policy Overview Brief
**Purpose**: Introduce a new or existing climate policy, outlining its objectives, scope, and alignment with Framework goals.

| **Section** | **Content** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Title** | E.g., National Carbon Tax Policy for Net-Zero by 2050 |
| **Context** | E.g., Country X emits 500 MtCO2e annually, with 60% from energy. The Framework targets a 50% emissions reduction by 2035. |
| **Policy Objectives** | E.g., Reduce emissions by 50% by 2035, fund just transition programs, align with Climate Mitigation pillar. |
| **Key Features** | E.g., Carbon tax of $50/tCO2e by 2026, scaling to $135/tCO2e by 2030; covers energy and industry; revenues fund renewable energy and worker retraining. |
| **Stakeholder Benefits** | E.g., Businesses gain policy clarity; 50,000 coal workers access retraining; rural communities benefit from clean energy. |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Supports 50% emissions reduction by 2035 and net-zero by 2050; integrates with [Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy). |
| **Call to Action** | E.g., Support policy adoption by 2026; engage via [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy). |

**Instructions**: 
- Keep brief (1-2 pages, ~500 words).
- Use data from the [Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS)](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Highlight equity benefits for vulnerable groups.

**Example**: 
**Title**: National Carbon Tax Policy for Net-Zero by 2050  
**Context**: Country X emits 500 MtCO2e annually, with 60% from energy. The Framework targets a 50% emissions reduction by 2035.  
**Policy Objectives**: Reduce emissions by 50% by 2035, fund just transition, align with Climate Mitigation pillar.  
**Key Features**: Carbon tax of $50/tCO2e by 2026, scaling to $135/tCO2e by 2030; covers energy and industry; 50% of revenues for retraining, 30% for renewables.  
**Stakeholder Benefits**: Businesses gain investment certainty; 50,000 coal workers retrained; rural areas access clean energy.  
**Alignment with Framework**: Supports 50% emissions reduction by 2035; uses [Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).  
**Call to Action**: Endorse policy by Q2 2026; join stakeholder forums via [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

### Template 2: Stakeholder Engagement Brief
**Purpose**: Communicate the process and outcomes of stakeholder engagement to ensure transparency and build trust.

| **Section** | **Content** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Title** | E.g., Stakeholder Engagement for Coastal Resilience Plan |
| **Context** | E.g., Region Y faces 1m sea level rise by 2050, affecting 200,000 residents. Engagement aligns with Framework’s equity principle. |
| **Engagement Objectives** | E.g., Co-design coastal adaptation measures, ensure Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities. |
| **Process** | E.g., Held 5 forums with 500 participants (CSOs, indigenous groups, businesses); conducted surveys for 1,000 residents. |
| **Key Outcomes** | E.g., Prioritized mangrove restoration (10,000 hectares); agreed on community-led implementation. |
| **Equity Considerations** | E.g., Provided translation services, funded participation for low-income groups, upheld FPIC. |
| **Next Steps** | E.g., Implement mangrove restoration by 2027; report via [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy). |

**Instructions**: 
- Keep brief (1 page, ~300 words).
- Reference the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for process details.
- Emphasize inclusion of marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous, low-income).

**Example**: 
**Title**: Stakeholder Engagement for Coastal Resilience Plan  
**Context**: Region Y faces 1m sea level rise by 2050, affecting 200,000 residents. Engagement aligns with Framework’s equity principle.
