# Stakeholder Engagement Protocol

## Introduction

The **Stakeholder Engagement Protocol** is a core tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to ensure inclusive, equitable, and effective participation of all relevant stakeholders in climate and energy governance. This protocol provides a structured approach for policymakers, regional authorities, and governance actors to engage governments, businesses, civil society organizations (CSOs), indigenous communities, and marginalized groups in co-designing and implementing policies that align with the Framework’s goals: achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, universal clean energy access, and climate resilience for vulnerable communities.

The protocol upholds the Framework’s principles of equity, cooperation, ethical governance, and adaptability, emphasizing procedural rights (access to information, participation, and justice) and mechanisms like Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities. By fostering meaningful stakeholder engagement, the protocol ensures that climate and energy policies reflect diverse perspectives, address local needs, and build trust across sectors.

### Objectives
- Facilitate inclusive participation of all stakeholder groups in governance processes.
- Uphold procedural rights and FPIC to ensure equitable decision-making.
- Integrate stakeholder input into policy design, implementation, and monitoring.
- Build trust and collaboration across sectors to support Framework implementation.
- Evaluate engagement outcomes to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and governance bodies
- Businesses engaged in climate and energy transitions
- CSOs, including NGOs, labor unions, and youth groups
- Indigenous communities and marginalized groups

## Stakeholder Engagement Protocol

### 1. Engagement Principles
Adhere to the following principles to ensure effective and equitable stakeholder engagement, aligned with the Framework’s guiding principles:

| **Principle** | **Description** | **Application** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Inclusivity** | Engage all relevant stakeholders, prioritizing marginalized and vulnerable groups. | E.g., Include indigenous communities, low-income workers, and youth in forums. |
| **Equity** | Ensure equitable access to participation and influence, addressing power imbalances. | E.g., Provide translation services, accessible venues, and financial support for participation. |
| **Transparency** | Share information openly and communicate how stakeholder input is used. | E.g., Publish engagement outcomes and policy decisions on public platforms. |
| **Accountability** | Establish mechanisms to monitor and evaluate engagement outcomes. | E.g., Use ICMS to track stakeholder participation rates and satisfaction. |
| **Respect for Rights** | Uphold procedural rights and FPIC for indigenous communities. | E.g., Implement FPIC processes for energy projects on indigenous lands. |
| **Adaptability** | Tailor engagement methods to local contexts and evolving needs. | E.g., Adjust consultation formats based on stakeholder feedback. |

**Instructions**: Integrate these principles into all engagement activities. Reference the Framework’s [Guiding Principles](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/docs/implementation/energy#02-guiding-principles) for further details.

### 2. Stakeholder Mapping
Identify and categorize stakeholders to ensure comprehensive engagement.

| **Stakeholder Group** | **Role** | **Interests/Needs** | **Engagement Priority** |
|-----------------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| E.g., National Government | Policy development, funding allocation | Align policies with Framework targets | High |
| E.g., Indigenous Communities | Rights holders, knowledge contributors | Protect land rights, ensure FPIC | High |
| E.g., Businesses (Renewable Energy) | Job creation, technology deployment | Access to incentives, policy clarity | Medium |
| E.g., CSOs (NGOs, Unions) | Advocacy, community representation | Equity, just transition support | High |
| E.g., Local Communities | Affected by projects, beneficiaries | Job opportunities, resilience measures | High |

**Instructions**: 
- List all relevant stakeholders in your context, focusing on those affected by or influencing climate and energy policies.
- Assign engagement priorities (High, Medium, Low) based on their influence and impact.
- Use the [Just Transition Planning Template](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for stakeholder mapping in just transition contexts.

**Example**: Indigenous communities in Region Y are prioritized for FPIC processes due to proposed wind farms on their lands, while renewable energy businesses are engaged for job creation partnerships.

### 3. Engagement Methods
Select and implement engagement methods tailored to stakeholder needs and governance objectives.

| **Method** | **Description** | **Use Case** | **Resources Needed** |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Multi-Stakeholder Forums** | Public meetings to co-design policies or projects. | E.g., Regional forum to develop renewable energy plans. | Venue, facilitators, translation services. |
| **Consultations** | Targeted discussions with specific groups (e.g., indigenous communities). | E.g., FPIC consultations for energy projects. | Cultural mediators, legal advisors. |
| **Workshops** | Interactive sessions to build capacity or gather input. | E.g., Climate literacy workshop for youth groups. | Trainers, educational materials. |
| **Surveys/Polls** | Collect broad input on policy preferences or needs. | E.g., Survey workers on retraining preferences. | Online platforms, data analysts. |
| **Advisory Panels** | Formal stakeholder representation in governance bodies. | E.g., Business advisory panel for carbon pricing. | Administrative support, meeting schedules. |

**Instructions**: 
- Choose methods based on stakeholder priorities and resources (e.g., use consultations for indigenous groups, forums for broad input).
- Ensure accessibility (e.g., virtual options, accessible venues, multiple languages).
- Document outcomes using the template in Section 4.

**Example**: A multi-stakeholder forum in Region Y engages 200 participants (government, businesses, CSOs) to co-design a 2035 renewable energy plan, with virtual access for remote communities.

### 4. Documenting and Integrating Input
Record stakeholder input and outline how it will be integrated into policies or projects.

| **Engagement Activity** | **Stakeholder Group** | **Input Provided** | **Integration Plan** | **Responsible Party** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| E.g., Forum on Renewable Energy | Businesses, CSOs | Need for solar job training programs | Include training in just transition plan | National Implementation Unit |
| E.g., FPIC Consultation | Indigenous Community | Concerns about wind farm impacts | Revise project to avoid sacred sites | Project Developer |
| E.g., Worker Survey | Coal Miners | Preference for wind turbine jobs | Prioritize wind training in retraining program | Labor Ministry |

**Instructions**: 
- Document all engagement activities, including participant numbers, key inputs, and decisions made.
- Communicate integration plans to stakeholders via public reports or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Use the [Climate Policy Integration Matrix](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to align input with broader policies.

**Example**: Input from a worker survey (500 coal miners) requesting wind turbine training is integrated into the just transition plan, with progress reported via the Climate Policy Dashboard.

### 5. Metrics for Success
Establish indicators to evaluate the effectiveness and equity of stakeholder engagement, aligned with the Framework’s Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS).

| **Indicator** | **Target** | **Measurement Method** | **Frequency** |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Stakeholder Participation Rate | 80% of identified stakeholders engaged by 2030 | Number of participants vs. invited stakeholders | Annual |
| Marginalized Group Inclusion | 75% of vulnerable groups represented by 2030 | Percentage of indigenous, low-income, or youth participants | Biennial |
| FPIC Compliance | 100% of projects on indigenous lands comply with FPIC by 2028 | Audit of project consent processes | Annual |
| Input Integration Rate | 70% of stakeholder inputs reflected in policies by 2035 | Analysis of policy documents vs. input records | Biennial |
| Stakeholder Satisfaction | 80% report satisfaction with engagement process by 2035 | Surveys or feedback forms | Annual |

**Instructions**: 
- Integrate metrics into ICMS for standardized reporting.
- Use surveys or focus groups to assess satisfaction and equity outcomes.
- Report progress via the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: Track participation in a 2026 forum (target: 80% of 300 invited stakeholders) and audit FPIC compliance for all 2028 energy projects, reporting results annually.
