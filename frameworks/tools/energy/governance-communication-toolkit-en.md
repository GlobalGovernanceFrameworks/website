# Governance Communication Toolkit

## Introduction

The **Governance Communication Toolkit** is a vital tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to empower stakeholders to communicate climate and energy governance strategies, policies, and progress effectively to diverse audiences. This toolkit supports policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and other actors in fostering transparency, building trust, and mobilizing support for the Framework’s goals, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring universal clean energy access, and protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035.

The toolkit integrates the Framework’s principles of equity, transparency, cooperation, and science-based decision-making, addressing all four pillars: Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology. It provides a suite of communication tools—messaging frameworks, presentation templates, social media guides, and community outreach strategies—to ensure clear, inclusive, and impactful messaging across governance levels and sectors.
