## Integration with Framework

The Bioregional Resource Sharing Protocol advances all four core principles of the Nested Sovereignty Framework:

- **Sovereignty**: Respects the self-determination of constituent communities while enabling coordination on shared concerns. The protocol creates differentiated decision rights that preserve local autonomy on community-scale issues while establishing collaborative governance for truly shared resources.

- **Interoperability**: Connects diverse local economic and governance systems through standardized bioregional protocols. Special attention to cross-scale compatibility ensures local currencies, cooperatives, and commons can function cohesively within bioregional networks while maintaining their distinct character.

- **Justice**: Addresses historical inequities through indigenous co-governance and explicit wealth redistribution mechanisms. The protocol's emphasis on balanced urban-rural relationships and targeted support for marginalized communities ensures bioregional wealth benefits all residents fairly.

- **Adaptability**: Builds learning processes appropriate to natural system dynamics and climate change. The protocol's emphasis on ecological monitoring, regular protocol updates, and flexible management approaches ensures bioregional governance can evolve as conditions change.

This protocol connects to other framework components by bridging local and global implementation. It provides the crucial middle scale where the Urban Economic Integration Toolkit and Rural Cooperative Development Guide meet, and creates the regional foundation for effective Global Economic Implementation.

## Call to Action

Communities, indigenous nations, municipalities, and organizations within shared bioregions are invited to apply this protocol to transform regional resource governance:

1. **For Watershed Communities**: Use the Watershed Governance Toolkit to establish collaborative water management across your entire basin.

2. **For Indigenous Nations**: Implement the Commons Management System to assert stewardship rights over traditional territories while building partnerships with other communities.

3. **For Local Governments**: Deploy the Cross-Jurisdiction Protocol Builder to create formal agreements with neighboring jurisdictions sharing ecological resources.

4. **For Regional Organizations**: Utilize the Bioregional Trade Framework to develop economic relationships aligned with natural boundaries and capacities.

5. **For All Bioregional Stakeholders**: Join the global community of bioregional practitioners at globalgovernanceframework.org/bioregional to share experiences and co-develop new implementation approaches.

By implementing these protocols, bioregional communities can create governance systems and economic relationships that respect ecological boundaries, honor diverse sovereignties, and ensure equitable benefit sharing. Bioregions provide the optimal scale for many aspects of economic and ecological governance, bridging local and global implementation of the Nested Sovereignty Framework.
