# Economic Micro-Grant Template

## Overview and Purpose

The Economic Micro-Grant Template provides communities and grassroots organizations with a structured pathway to access small-scale funding for implementing components of the Nested Sovereignty Framework. Designed specifically for resource-constrained contexts, this template enables local initiatives to secure modest but catalytic funding to launch currencies, cooperatives, commons governance, or other framework elements with minimal administrative burden.

This template embodies the principles of <span style="color: blue;">sovereignty</span>, <span style="color: green;">interoperability</span>, <span style="color: red;">justice</span>, and <span style="color: purple;">adaptability</span> by prioritizing local decision-making, ensuring compatibility with larger systems, embedding equity in all processes, and allowing flexible implementation based on context.
