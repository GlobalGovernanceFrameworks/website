## <a id="overview-and-purpose"></a>Overview and Purpose

The Economic Analysis Framework provides stakeholders with a structured approach to assess, evaluate, and plan economic systems within the Nested Sovereignty Framework. It enables communities, regions, and global actors to examine current economic conditions, model potential interventions, and monitor outcomes through a methodology that honors sovereignty, interoperability, justice, and adaptability. By integrating quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, including indigenous and marginalized perspectives, this framework supports evidence-based decision-making while ensuring cultural relevance and inclusivity.

### Core Functions
- **Baseline Assessment**: Analyze existing economic conditions before framework implementation
- **Intervention Modeling**: Project impacts of various economic interventions (e.g., currencies, cooperatives)
- **Outcome Evaluation**: Measure results against sovereignty, justice, and adaptability goals
- **Cross-Scale Analysis**: Connect local, regional, and global economic data for comprehensive insights
- **Decision Support**: Provide evidence for governance and policy decisions

### Guiding Principles
- **Mixed Methods**: Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative insights and traditional knowledge
- **Participatory Analysis**: Include diverse stakeholders, especially marginalized voices, in analytical processes
- **Transparent Methodology**: Ensure all analytical approaches are accessible and understandable to communities
- **Appropriate Technology**: Provide both high-tech and low-tech analytical options for diverse contexts
- **Cultural Relevance**: Respect and integrate indigenous economic concepts and evaluation approaches
