## Core Currency Design Principles

Successful community currencies embody these five principles:

### 1. Value Foundation Integrity
Your currency must have a clear and robust foundation of value, balanced across three dimensions:
- **Community Trust**: Social agreements and collective confidence
- **Real Economy Backing**: Connection to goods, services, and resources
- **Design Integrity**: Technical features that support circulation and stability

### 2. Appropriate Sovereignty
Your currency should maintain clear local control while enabling broader economic participation:
- **Local Decision-Making**: Community governance over core currency parameters
- **Regional Alignment**: Compatibility with neighboring community systems
- **Global Standards**: Adherence to framework interoperability protocols

### 3. Inclusive Access
Your currency must be accessible to all community members regardless of resources or abilities:
- **Multiple Access Points**: Digital and physical currency formats
- **Minimal Participation Barriers**: Low or no costs to join and use
- **Universal Design**: Accessibility for different languages, literacy levels, and abilities

### 4. Circulation Optimization
Your currency should be designed to move regularly throughout the community:
- **Demurrage or Incentives**: Features that encourage circulation rather than hoarding
- **Exchange Limitations**: Appropriate constraints on conversion to national currency
- **Business Network Development**: Strategies to create complete transaction circuits

### 5. Resilience and Adaptability
Your currency should withstand shocks and evolve with community needs:
- **Volatility Management**: Mechanisms to maintain stability during economic disruption
- **Feedback Systems**: Regular community input to guide evolution
- **Crisis Protocols**: Clear procedures for maintaining function during emergencies

## Design Process Guide

Follow this step-by-step process to design your community currency:

### Step 1: Stakeholder Engagement (2-3 months)
- Form a currency design team with diverse representation
- Conduct community needs assessment through surveys and dialogues
- Map existing economic flows using the Resource Mapping Tool
- Identify priority economic challenges to address (leakage, underutilized resources, etc.)

**Key Deliverable**: Community Economic Needs Summary (2-3 pages)

### Step 2: Purpose and Values Definition (1 month)
- Articulate clear purpose statement for your currency
- Define core values that will guide currency design
- Establish primary and secondary objectives
- Create evaluation metrics aligned with community goals

**Key Deliverable**: Currency Purpose and Values Statement (1 page)

### Step 3: Currency Model Selection (1-2 months)
- Review available currency models and their features
- Assess alignment with community context and needs
- Select and adapt appropriate model(s)

**Working Models to Consider**:
1. **Mutual Credit System**: Zero-sum accounting system where credits and debits always equal zero
2. **Locally Issued Currency**: Community-backed paper or digital currency with national currency reserves
3. **Time-Based Currency**: System valuing hours of service equally regardless of service type
4. **Dual-Currency System**: Complementary currency operating alongside national currency with fixed exchange
5. **Resource-Backed Currency**: Value tied to specific local resources or production
6. **Hybrid Model**: Combination of multiple currency approaches

**Key Deliverable**: Currency Model Selection Document (3-5 pages)

### Step 4: Technical Design (2-3 months)
- Develop detailed operational specifications
- Design issuance, circulation, and redemption mechanisms

### Step 5: Implementation Planning (1-2 months)
- Develop phased rollout strategy
- Create marketing and community engagement plan
- Establish business recruitment strategy
- Design monitoring and evaluation framework

**Key Deliverable**: Implementation Plan (5-7 pages)

### Step 6: Pilot Launch (3-6 months)
- Implement in limited geographic area or sector

## Currency Foundation Elements

Every community currency requires these foundational elements:

### Value Anchoring
Determine what gives your currency value:

**Option 1: Fiat National Currency Backing**
- Reserved national currency (typically 25-100% backing ratio)
- Pros: Easily understood, high initial trust
- Cons: Reproduces national currency limitations, vulnerable to external economic shocks
- Examples: BerkShares (USA), Bristol Pound (UK)

**Option 2: Real Economy Backing**
- Local goods and services (acceptance agreements with businesses)
- Pros: Direct connection to local economy, not dependent on national currency
- Cons: Requires broad business participation to establish value
- Examples: Transition Currency (Japan), SoNantes (France)

**Option 3: Time/Labor Backing**
- Human time and skills (1 hour standard unit)
- Pros: Inherent equality, not subject to inflation
- Cons: Challenging for goods or business integration
- Examples: Hour Exchange (USA), Fureai Kippu (Japan)

**Option 4: Mixed Backing System**
- Combination of multiple value anchors
- Pros: Most resilient, addresses multiple needs
- Cons: More complex to design and explain
- Examples: Banco Palmas (Brazil), Sardex (Italy)

### Issuance Mechanisms
Determine how your currency enters circulation:

**Option 1: Purchase/Exchange**
- Issued when bought with national currency
- Pros: Simple, builds initial reserves
- Cons: Accessibility barriers, reproduces financial exclusion
- Implementation: Exchange offices, online platforms, participating businesses

**Option 2: Backing Assets**
- Issued against community assets (land, buildings, future production)
- Pros: Independent from national currency, builds community wealth
- Cons: More complex legally and operationally
- Implementation: Community trust structures, cooperative ownership

**Option 3: Mutual Credit**
- Created at moment of transaction, always sums to zero
- Pros: No central issuance needed, self-regulating
- Cons: Requires trust and consistent participation
- Implementation: Credit limits, account management systems

**Option 4: Public Spending**
- Issued through local government for services, grants, or income
- Pros: Combines public backing with community circulation
- Cons: Requires government participation, potential political challenges
- Implementation: Municipal agreements, public service programs

### Circulation Features
Determine how your currency will maintain healthy movement:

**Option 1: Demurrage (Negative Interest)**
- Currency loses value over time (typically 2-8% annually)
- Pros: Encourages spending over saving, increases velocity
- Cons: More complex to explain and implement
- Implementation: Stamping systems, digital expiration, fee schedules

**Option 2: Incentive Programs**
- Bonuses for using currency (extra value, rewards, etc.)
- Pros: Positive encouragement rather than penalties
- Cons: Requires funding source for incentives
- Implementation: Business discounts, transaction bonuses, loyalty features

**Option 3: Use Obligations**
- Required payments in community currency (taxes, fees, etc.)
- Pros: Creates consistent demand, ensures circulation
- Cons: Requires institutional participation
- Implementation: Utility payment options, local tax agreements

**Option 4: Exchange Limitations**
- Restrictions or costs for converting back to national currency
- Pros: Keeps value circulating locally
- Cons: May discourage business participation
- Implementation: Redemption fees, exchange windows, business-only redemption
