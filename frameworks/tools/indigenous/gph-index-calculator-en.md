# Gross Planetary Health Index Calculator
*Measuring True Prosperity Through Ecological and Cultural Vitality*

> *"True wealth cannot be counted in coins or paper—it lives in the health of our children, the songs of the birds, the purity of our water."*  
> — Cherokee teaching

## Purpose and Overview

This comprehensive calculator provides Indigenous communities, governments, and organizations with tools for measuring Gross Planetary Health (GPH)—an alternative to Gross Domestic Product that prioritizes ecological restoration, cultural vitality, and intergenerational wellbeing over extraction and accumulation. The GPH Index reflects Indigenous understanding of true prosperity through relationship with all beings and responsibility to future generations.

**What is the Gross Planetary Health Index?**
The GPH Index measures economic and social success through ecological restoration, cultural vitality, and community wellbeing rather than extraction and accumulation. Based on Indigenous values of reciprocity, regeneration, and seven-generation thinking, GPH provides a comprehensive alternative to GDP that serves planetary healing and Indigenous sovereignty.

**Core Measurement Framework**:
- **Ecological Health (40% weight)**: Biodiversity, water purity, soil health, and ecosystem restoration
- **Cultural Resilience (30% weight)**: Language vitality, traditional knowledge transmission, and ceremonial participation
- **Community Wellbeing (30% weight)**: Housing security, food sovereignty, mental health, and social cohesion

**Calculator Applications**:
- **Bioregional Autonomous Zone assessment**: Measuring BAZ success and ecological restoration progress
- **Policy impact evaluation**: Assessing government policies for ecological and cultural impact
- **Community development planning**: Guiding Indigenous community development priorities
- **Economic transition tracking**: Monitoring transition from extractive to regenerative economics
- **International comparison**: Demonstrating superior outcomes of Indigenous governance systems

## Part I: GPH Index Framework and Methodology

### Section 1: Theoretical Foundation and Indigenous Values

#### 1.1 Indigenous Economic Philosophy

**Traditional Wealth Concepts**:
The GPH Index emerges from Indigenous understanding that true prosperity comes from healthy relationships with all beings, ecological abundance, and cultural vitality rather than individual accumulation or resource extraction.

**Core Indigenous Principles**:
- **Reciprocity with Nature**: Economic success measured through giving back to ecosystems rather than taking from them
- **Seven-Generation Thinking**: Prosperity evaluated for impact on children seven generations into the future
- **Gift Economy Integration**: Wealth measured through community sharing and mutual aid rather than individual accumulation
- **Cultural Vitality**: Economic health including maintenance of traditional languages, ceremonies, and knowledge systems
- **All Relations Recognition**: Economic systems recognizing kinship with human and non-human beings

**Traditional Prosperity Indicators**:
- [ ] **Ecological Abundance**: Healthy ecosystems providing for all community needs without depletion
- [ ] **Cultural Transmission**: Successful transmission of traditional knowledge, languages, and practices to next generations
- [ ] **Community Cohesion**: Strong social relationships, mutual aid systems, and collective decision-making
- [ ] **Spiritual Wellbeing**: Maintenance of traditional spiritual practices and ceremonial life
- [ ] **Intergenerational Justice**: Community conditions improving across generations rather than depleting resources

#### 1.2 GPH vs. GDP Comparison Framework

**Fundamental Differences in Measurement Philosophy**:
GPH and GDP represent fundamentally different approaches to measuring prosperity, with GPH prioritizing regeneration and relationship while GDP prioritizes extraction and accumulation.

**GDP Limitations and Extractive Focus**:
- **Extraction as Growth**: GDP counts resource extraction and environmental destruction as positive economic activity
- **Cultural Destruction Ignored**: GDP does not measure cultural vitality, language loss, or traditional knowledge destruction
- **Inequality Blindness**: GDP measures total economic activity without considering distribution or community wellbeing
- **Short-Term Focus**: GDP prioritizes quarterly and annual growth over long-term sustainability and intergenerational justice
- **Ecological Costs Externalized**: GDP does not account for environmental damage or ecosystem service loss

**GPH Regenerative Alternative**:
- **Restoration as Progress**: GPH counts ecological restoration and cultural revitalization as positive progress
- **Cultural Vitality Integration**: GPH includes language revitalization, traditional knowledge transmission, and ceremonial participation
- **Equity and Justice**: GPH measures community wellbeing, social cohesion, and traditional wealth distribution systems
- **Seven-Generation Accountability**: GPH evaluates policies and economic activities for long-term impact on future generations
- **Ecological Integration**: GPH recognizes ecosystem health as fundamental foundation for human prosperity

**Comparative Outcomes Framework**:
- [ ] **Ecological Health**: GPH-guided communities demonstrate superior biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem restoration
- [ ] **Cultural Vitality**: GPH communities maintain strong traditional languages, knowledge systems, and ceremonial practices
- [ ] **Community Wellbeing**: GPH communities report higher life satisfaction, social cohesion, and mental health
- [ ] **Sustainability**: GPH communities use resources at rates that maintain abundance across generations
- [ ] **Resilience**: GPH communities demonstrate superior resilience to climate change and economic disruption

### Section 4: GPH Calculation Methodology

#### 4.1 Scoring and Weighting System

**GPH Index Calculation Framework**:
```
GPH Score = (Ecological Health × 0.40) + (Cultural Resilience × 0.30) + (Community Wellbeing × 0.30)

Where each component is scored 0-100 based on traditional knowledge assessment and contemporary monitoring
```

**Component Scoring Methodology**:

**Ecological Health Scoring (40% weight)**:
```
Ecological Health = (Biodiversity Score × 0.40) + (Water Quality × 0.30) + (Soil Health × 0.20) + (Air Quality × 0.10)

Biodiversity Score = (Species Population Health + Habitat Connectivity + Traditional Management Success) / 3
Water Quality = (Drinking Water Standards + Aquatic Ecosystem Health + Traditional Water Management) / 3  
Soil Health = (Carbon Sequestration + Soil Microbial Health + Traditional Agriculture Success) / 3
Air Quality = (Air Purity + Climate Regulation + Traditional Fire Management) / 3
```

**Cultural Resilience Scoring (30% weight)**:
```
Cultural Resilience = (Language Vitality × 0.40) + (Traditional Knowledge × 0.30) + (Cultural Practice × 0.30)

Language Vitality = (Fluent Speakers + Youth Learning + Traditional Use + Documentation) / 4
Traditional Knowledge = (Elder-Youth Transmission + Traditional Skills + Knowledge Innovation) / 3
Cultural Practice = (Ceremonial Participation + Traditional Arts + Cultural Identity Strength) / 3
```

**Community Wellbeing Scoring (30% weight)**:
```
Community Wellbeing = (Housing Security × 0.30) + (Food Sovereignty × 0.30) + (Mental Health × 0.40)

Housing Security = (Adequate Housing + Traditional Architecture + Community Infrastructure) / 3
Food Sovereignty = (Traditional Food Access + Food System Sustainability + Community Production) / 3
Mental Health = (Community Satisfaction + Traditional Wellness + Social Cohesion) / 3
```

**Cultural Protocol Reminder**: GPH Index implementation must follow appropriate Indigenous cultural protocols and traditional governance systems. All measurement and evaluation activities should strengthen rather than compromise traditional knowledge transmission and occur under traditional authority and elder guidance. Sacred knowledge and cultural information require protection throughout GPH assessment and monitoring processes.
