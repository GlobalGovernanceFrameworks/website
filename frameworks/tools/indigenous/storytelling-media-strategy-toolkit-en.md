**Indigenous Media Sovereignty Reminder**: All media strategy and content creation must operate under Indigenous governance and traditional authority. Communities maintain exclusive control over their narratives, Traditional Knowledge sharing, and media representation. No external organization can develop Indigenous media strategy without appropriate community invitation and ongoing traditional governance oversight.

**Cultural Protocol Supremacy**: Traditional cultural protocols and sacred knowledge boundaries always take precedence over media strategy requirements. Media engagement must strengthen traditional governance and cultural practices, never compromise them for external audience engagement.

**Red Lines Protection**: Indigenous communities maintain authority to modify, withdraw from, or redirect media engagement if it threatens cultural integrity or becomes co-opted by external interests seeking to control Indigenous narratives.

*This Storytelling & Media Strategy Toolkit empowers Indigenous communities to amplify their voices for planetary transformation while maintaining cultural sovereignty and traditional authority over narrative content and representation. Success is measured by traditional governance strengthening and cultural revitalization rather than external media metrics.*
