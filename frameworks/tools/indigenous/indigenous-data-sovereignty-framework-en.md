# Indigenous Data Sovereignty Framework
*Community-Controlled Data Governance and Digital Self-Determination*

> *"Our knowledge is ours to protect and share. Data is not neutral—it carries the spirit of those who create it and the responsibility of those who hold it."*  
> — Navajo teaching

## Purpose and Overview

This framework establishes comprehensive protocols for Indigenous Data Sovereignty—the rights of Indigenous peoples to control the collection, ownership, storage, and application of data about Indigenous communities, territories, resources, and cultural knowledge systems. The framework ensures Indigenous communities maintain complete authority over their digital information while participating in ethical data collaboration and technological development.

**What is Indigenous Data Sovereignty?**
Indigenous Data Sovereignty encompasses Indigenous peoples' inherent rights and interests relating to the collection, ownership, and application of data about Indigenous peoples, their territories, resources, knowledge systems, and cultural practices. It extends traditional governance authority into digital realms, ensuring technology serves Indigenous self-determination rather than colonial extraction.

**Core Principles**:
- **Indigenous Authority**: Indigenous communities hold ultimate decision-making power over all data affecting their people, territories, and knowledge
- **Community Control**: Data governance operates under traditional governance systems and cultural protocols
- **Cultural Protocol Integration**: All data activities respect traditional spiritual practices and cultural requirements
- **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0**: Enhanced consent protocols with ongoing authority and veto power
- **Traditional Knowledge Protection**: Sacred and cultural knowledge receives absolute protection from unauthorized access

**Framework Outcomes**:
- Complete Indigenous control over community data collection and use
- Protection of Traditional Knowledge from digital appropriation
- Community-controlled research and technology development
- Economic benefits from ethical data applications
- Legal protection and advocacy capacity enhancement

**Cultural Protocol Reminder**: Indigenous Data Sovereignty implementation must follow appropriate cultural protocols and traditional governance systems. All data activities should strengthen rather than compromise traditional knowledge transmission and occur under traditional authority and elder guidance. Sacred knowledge requires absolute protection and should never be included in digital systems without explicit traditional spiritual authority permission.
