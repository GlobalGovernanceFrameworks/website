## Community Readiness Assessment

### Traditional Governance Foundation Evaluation

**Elder Council and Traditional Authority Assessment**:
Before any framework implementation, communities must demonstrate strong traditional governance foundation and elder authority over cultural protocols:

**Assessment Questions for Community Reflection**:
1. Do our elders and traditional knowledge keepers support framework engagement?
2. Can our traditional governance systems maintain authority over implementation decisions?
3. Will framework participation strengthen or compromise our cultural practices?

**Indigenous Sovereignty Reminder**: This Cultural Integrity Replication Protocol operates under Indigenous governance and traditional authority. Implementation requires Indigenous community invitation, traditional governance oversight, and ongoing cultural protocol compliance. No external organization can implement framework components without appropriate Indigenous community authority and cultural guidance.

**Red Lines Protection**: Indigenous communities maintain absolute authority to modify, suspend, or terminate framework implementation if cultural integrity is threatened or if implementation conflicts with traditional governance and cultural protocols.

**Cultural Protocol Supremacy**: Traditional governance and cultural practices always take precedence over framework technical requirements. Framework implementation must adapt to Indigenous cultural protocols, never the reverse.

---

*This Cultural Integrity Replication Protocol ensures that framework implementation serves Indigenous self-determination and cultural vitality while preventing appropriation and colonial co-optation. Success is measured by traditional governance strengthening and cultural revitalization rather than external implementation standards.*
