# BAZ Readiness Assessment & Setup Guide
*Bioregional Autonomous Zone Development for Indigenous Communities*

> *"The river does not recognize the border. The salmon do not carry passports. Why should governance ignore the teachings of the watershed?"*  
> â€” Coast Salish teaching

## Purpose and Overview

This comprehensive guide supports Indigenous communities in assessing readiness for establishing Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) and provides step-by-step setup protocols. BAZs represent self-governing territories organized around watersheds, ecosystems, and traditional territories rather than colonial nation-state boundaries, with Indigenous peoples leading stewardship of their traditional territories.

**What is a Bioregional Autonomous Zone?**
A BAZ is a self-governing territory where Indigenous communities exercise sovereignty over traditional territories through ecosystem-based governance that respects watershed boundaries, seasonal cycles, and ecological relationships. BAZs operate through traditional governance systems while coordinating with other Indigenous communities for bioregional stewardship and climate adaptation.

**Key Features**:
- **Watershed-based governance** following water from mountain to sea
- **Traditional governance authority** with rotating councils and consensus decision-making
- **Ecosystem integration** respecting habitat boundaries and wildlife corridors
- **Cultural calendar alignment** organizing governance around ecological rhythms
- **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0** with Indigenous veto power over external decisions

**Target Outcomes**:
- 50% biodiversity increase through Traditional Ecological Knowledge management
- Traditional governance recognition and legal authority
- Economic sovereignty through regenerative development
- Cultural revitalization and Traditional Knowledge transmission
- Climate adaptation leadership using Indigenous knowledge systems
