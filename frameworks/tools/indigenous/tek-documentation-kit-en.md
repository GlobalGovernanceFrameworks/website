> â€” Navajo teaching

## Purpose and Overview

This comprehensive kit provides Indigenous communities with protocols, tools, and frameworks for documenting Traditional Knowledge while maintaining community control, cultural integrity, and intellectual property protection. The kit supports communities in participating in the Global Indigenous Creative Commons (GICC) while ensuring Traditional Knowledge remains under Indigenous authority and serves community priorities.

**What is Traditional Knowledge Documentation?**
Traditional Knowledge documentation involves recording, organizing, and protecting Indigenous knowledge systems including Traditional Ecological Knowledge, governance practices, cultural protocols, spiritual traditions, and technological innovations. Documentation serves multiple purposes: cultural preservation, intergenerational transmission, legal protection, and ethical sharing for planetary healing.

**Core Principles**:
- **Community Control**: Indigenous communities maintain ultimate authority over all Traditional Knowledge documentation and sharing
- **Elder Authority**: Traditional knowledge keepers and elders guide documentation priorities and cultural protocols
- **Cultural Integrity**: Documentation strengthens rather than compromises traditional knowledge transmission and cultural practices
- **Sacred Boundary Protection**: Sacred and ceremonial knowledge receives absolute protection from external access
- **Reciprocity and Relationship**: Traditional Knowledge sharing operates through reciprocal relationships rather than extractive appropriation

**Documentation Outcomes**:
- Legal protection from biopiracy and cultural appropriation
- Enhanced intergenerational Traditional Knowledge transmission
- Ethical sharing for climate adaptation and ecological restoration
- Community economic benefits from Traditional Knowledge applications
- Cultural revitalization and traditional practice strengthening
