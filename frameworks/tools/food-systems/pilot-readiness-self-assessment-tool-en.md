The *Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool* is a practical resource to help stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local governments—evaluate their readiness to launch a pilot project under the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. By assessing capacity in key areas, this tool ensures pilot projects align with the framework’s [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives) and [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles) of sustainability, equity, resilience, and transparency. Designed for accessibility, it supports stakeholders in identifying strengths, gaps, and actionable steps to implement successful pilots that contribute to resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems.

## Overview
The tool provides a structured checklist to assess readiness across four key areas:
1. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Ability to involve diverse groups, including marginalized communities.
2. **Resources and Capacity**: Availability of funding, skills, and infrastructure.
3. **Alignment with Framework Objectives**: Consistency with the framework’s goals, such as food security and regenerative practices.
4. **Risk Management and Resilience**: Preparedness for challenges like climate shocks or policy barriers.

Each area includes questions with a scoring system (0–3) and guidance for improvement. The tool is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and supports the framework’s [Implementation Mechanisms](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

*Accessible explanation*: This tool helps you check if you’re ready to start a small project, like a new farm, by asking questions about your team, resources, and plans.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

## Instructions
1. **Review Questions**: Answer each question in the checklist honestly, considering your current capacity and resources.
2. **Score Responses**: Assign a score from 0 to 3 based on the provided criteria:
   - 0: Not in place or no plan.
   - 1: Initial steps taken but incomplete.
   - 2: Partially in place with clear plans to improve.
   - 3: Fully in place and operational.
3. **Calculate Totals**: Sum scores for each section and overall to assess readiness.
4. **Identify Next Steps**: Use the guidance provided to address gaps and strengthen readiness.
5. **Revisit Regularly**: Update the assessment as your project evolves to track progress.

*Accessible explanation*: Answer the questions, give yourself a score, add them up, and use the tips to get ready for your project.

## Assessment Checklist
### Stakeholder Engagement
**Objective**: Ensure inclusive collaboration with diverse stakeholders, as outlined in [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement).

| Question | Score (0–3) | Guidance for Improvement |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Have you identified key stakeholders (e.g., farmers, indigenous communities, youth, local governments) for your pilot? | | Map stakeholders using the [Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.pdf). Engage at least 3 diverse groups. |
| Is there a plan to include marginalized groups (e.g., women, indigenous, refugees) in decision-making? | | Develop a co-governance plan with 50% representation from marginalized groups, per framework recommendations. |
| Are regular dialogues or workshops planned to align stakeholder priorities? | | Schedule at least 2 workshops in the first 6 months, involving 10–20 participants, to build trust. |
| Is there a mechanism to resolve conflicts among stakeholders? | | Adopt Consensus Building Institute protocols, as outlined in the framework, and appoint a neutral facilitator. |

*Accessible explanation*: Check if you have the right people involved, especially those often left out, and a way to work together fairly.

### Resources and Capacity
**Objective**: Confirm availability of funding, skills, and infrastructure to support the pilot.

| Question | Score (0–3) | Guidance for Improvement |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Do you have access to funding or resources (e.g., grants, local budgets) to start the pilot? | | Explore local grants, crowdfunding, or partnerships with NGOs. Aim for at least $5,000–$10,000 for a micro-pilot. |
| Are there trained individuals (e.g., farmers, trainers) to implement regenerative practices or TEK? | | Use the [Regenerative Farming Guide](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/regenerative-farming-guide-en.pdf) to train at least 5–10 individuals before launch. |
| Is necessary infrastructure (e.g., irrigation, seed banks) available or planned? | | Plan for low-cost solutions like rainwater harvesting, targeting 1–2 systems within 6 months. |
| Do you have access to technology (e.g., SMS alerts, data platforms) to support the pilot? | | Partner with local tech providers or use low-tech solutions like radio, as outlined in [Foster Innovation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives). |

*Accessible explanation*: Make sure you have money, trained people, tools, and technology to start your project.

### Alignment with Framework Objectives
**Objective**: Ensure the pilot supports the framework’s goals, as detailed in [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives).

| Question | Score (0–3) | Guidance for Improvement |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Does the pilot promote regenerative agriculture or agroecology? | | Incorporate at least 1 regenerative practice (e.g., cover cropping) using the [Regenerative Farming Guide](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/regenerative-farming-guide-en.pdf). |
| Will the pilot improve food security or access to nutritious food locally? | | Design the pilot to serve at least 50–100 people with affordable food, aligning with SDG 2. |
| Does the pilot integrate TEK or involve indigenous communities? | | Partner with indigenous groups to co-design 1 TEK-based practice, per [Integration of TEK](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms). |
| Is the pilot scalable to contribute to regional or national goals? | | Plan for scalability by documenting outcomes and engaging regional networks, as in [Regional Customization](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#10-regional-customization). |

*Accessible explanation*: Check if your project helps grow food sustainably, feeds people, uses local wisdom, and can grow bigger.

### Risk Management and Resilience
**Objective**: Assess preparedness for challenges, as outlined in [Risk Management](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#11-risk-management).

| Question | Score (0–3) | Guidance for Improvement |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Have you identified potential risks (e.g., drought, market disruptions) for your pilot? | | Conduct a risk assessment using the framework’s risk categories (e.g., climate, geopolitical) and list 3–5 risks. |
| Is there a plan to mitigate climate-related risks (e.g., crop insurance, drought-resistant crops)? | | Adopt 1–2 mitigation strategies, like drought-resistant seeds, as in [Regional Customization](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#10-regional-customization). |
| Are there contingency plans for supply chain or policy disruptions? | | Develop a backup plan, such as local sourcing, to ensure 30% of inputs are locally secured. |
| Does the pilot include measures to protect data or technology (if applicable)? | | Implement basic cybersecurity protocols, like secure passwords, for any digital tools, per framework guidelines. |

*Accessible explanation*: Plan for problems like bad weather or supply issues to keep your project strong.

## Scoring and Next Steps
**Scoring**:
- **Total Score**: Sum the scores across all questions (maximum 48 points, 12 questions × 3 points each).
- **Readiness Levels**:
  - **0–15**: Low readiness. Focus on building stakeholder partnerships and securing resources. Reassess in 3–6 months.
  - **16–30**: Moderate readiness. Address key gaps (e.g., training, risk planning) and aim to launch a micro-pilot within 6–12 months.
  - **31–48**: High readiness. Proceed with pilot planning, using tools like the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip), and launch within 3–6 months.

**Next Steps**:
- **Low Readiness**: Engage with local NGOs or use the [Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.pdf) to build partnerships. Seek funding opportunities via the [Cost-Benefit Analysis Model](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/cost-benefit-analysis-model-en.pdf).
- **Moderate Readiness**: Prioritize training with the [Regenerative Farming Guide](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/regenerative-farming-guide-en.pdf) and develop a risk mitigation plan. Schedule stakeholder workshops to align goals.
- **High Readiness**: Finalize pilot design, set KPIs using the [Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf), and launch the pilot, documenting outcomes for scalability.

**Example**:
- A smallholder cooperative in Kenya scores 28 (moderate readiness). They lack TEK integration (score: 1) and risk planning (score: 1). They use the [TEK Integration Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/tek-integration-template-en.pdf) to partner with indigenous groups and adopt drought-resistant crops, reassessing in 3 months to reach high readiness.

*Accessible explanation*: Add up your scores to see how ready you are, then follow tips to improve and start your project.
