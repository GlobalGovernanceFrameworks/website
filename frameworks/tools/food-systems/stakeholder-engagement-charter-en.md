The *Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template* is a customizable tool to formalize inclusive collaboration among stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors—implementing the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. It establishes a shared commitment to equitable, transparent, and resilient food systems, aligning with the framework’s [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles) of sustainability, equity, resilience, and transparency. Designed for pilot projects or broader initiatives, this charter supports the framework’s [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement) goals and is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip).

## Overview
The charter template provides a structured agreement to:
- Define the purpose and scope of collaboration.
- Outline roles and responsibilities for diverse stakeholders.
- Establish principles for inclusive engagement.
- Set clear decision-making and conflict resolution processes.
- Secure stakeholder commitment through signatures.

This tool ensures marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous communities, women, youth, refugees) have a voice in governance, fostering trust and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

*Accessible explanation*: This template is a written promise to work together fairly, making sure everyone, especially those often left out, helps decide how to improve food systems.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

## Instructions
1. **Customize the Template**: Replace placeholders (e.g., [Project Name], [Region]) with specific details about your project or initiative.
2. **Engage Stakeholders**: Convene a workshop with all stakeholders to review and agree on the charter’s content, ensuring inclusive input.
3. **Complete Sections**: Fill in each section, tailoring roles, principles, and processes to your context.
4. **Sign and Share**: Have stakeholders sign the charter to formalize commitment, then distribute copies and post publicly (e.g., on community boards or globalgovernanceframework.org).
5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit the charter annually or as needed to update roles or processes, ensuring ongoing alignment.

*Accessible explanation*: Fill in the blanks with your project’s details, talk with your team to agree, sign it, share it, and check it every year.

## Charter Template
### Purpose and Scope
**Purpose**: This Stakeholder Engagement Charter for [Project Name] establishes a collaborative framework to implement [specific goal, e.g., a regenerative farming pilot] in [Region]. It aligns with the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* to promote resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems.

**Scope**: The charter covers activities including [list key activities, e.g., training farmers in regenerative practices, establishing a local food hub], engaging stakeholders from [list groups, e.g., smallholder farmers, indigenous communities, youth], and achieving outcomes such as [list outcomes, e.g., 10% increase in local food access by 2026].

*Accessible explanation*: Explain why your group is working together and what you plan to do, like starting a farm project in your area.

### Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities
**Objective**: Define the roles and contributions of each stakeholder group to ensure clarity and accountability.

| Stakeholder Group | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------------------|------|------------------|
| [e.g., Smallholder Farmers] | Implementers | Adopt regenerative practices; share local knowledge; participate in workshops. |

*Accessible explanation*: List who’s involved, like farmers or youth, and what they’ll do, making sure everyone has a fair role.

### Engagement Principles
**Objective**: Establish shared values to guide collaboration, reflecting the framework’s [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles).

- **Equity**: Prioritize voices of marginalized groups, ensuring fair access to resources and decision-making.
- **Transparency**: Share decisions and outcomes openly through regular updates (e.g., community meetings, online dashboards).
- **Sustainability**: Focus on long-term environmental and social benefits, such as regenerative agriculture.
- **Resilience**: Build adaptive strategies to address challenges like climate shocks or market disruptions.
- **Inclusivity**: Engage diverse stakeholders, respecting cultural and regional contexts, per UNDRIP.

*Accessible explanation*: Agree on rules like being fair, open, and ready for challenges to work together well.

### Decision-Making Processes
**Objective**: Define how decisions are made to ensure inclusivity and consensus.

- **Structure**: Decisions are made by a [Steering Committee/Working Group], with [number, e.g., 10] members representing all stakeholder groups.
- **Process**: Use participatory decision-making requiring [e.g., 75%] consensus. Major decisions (e.g., budget allocation) require approval from [e.g., indigenous representatives].
- **Frequency**: Hold [e.g., monthly] meetings to review progress and make decisions, with agendas shared [e.g., one week] in advance.
- **Documentation**: Record decisions in a shared log, accessible via [e.g., community portal, globalgovernanceframework.org].

*Accessible explanation*: Decide as a team, with most people agreeing, and keep notes on what you decide.

### Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
**Objective**: Provide a fair process to address disputes, as outlined in [Conflict Resolution](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

- **Mediation Panel**: Form a neutral panel of [number, e.g., 3–5] members, including [e.g., an indigenous leader, a youth representative], trained in Consensus Building Institute protocols.
- **Process**: Conflicts are addressed within [e.g., 14 days] through mediation sessions, aiming for mutually agreed solutions.
