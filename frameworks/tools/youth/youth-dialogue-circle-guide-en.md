## üöÄ Getting Started: The 5-Step Launch Process

### **Step 1: Clarify Your Purpose and Vision (Week 1)**

**Define Your "Why"**
- What issue or question do you want to explore?
- What change do you hope to see in your community?
- Why is this important to you personally?

**Examples of Circle Purposes:**
- üè´ **School Issues**: "How can we make our school more inclusive and supportive for all students?"
- üåç **Climate Action**: "What can young people in our town do about climate change?"
- ü§ù **Community Relations**: "How can we bridge divides between different groups in our neighborhood?"
- üí∞ **Economic Justice**: "How do we address inequality and create opportunities for all young people?"
- üè† **Housing**: "What solutions exist for young people facing housing insecurity?"
- üì± **Digital Wellness**: "How do we maintain healthy relationships with technology and social media?"

**Create Your Vision Statement**
Write 1-2 sentences describing what success looks like for your circle.

*Example: "Our circle will bring together students from different backgrounds to understand each other's experiences and develop projects that make our school a place where everyone feels they belong."*

### **Step 2: Plan the Logistics (Week 2)**

**Choose Your Format**
- **In-Person**: Better for building trust and connection
- **Virtual**: More accessible for people with transportation/scheduling challenges
- **Hybrid**: Combine both for maximum inclusion

**Decide on Frequency and Duration**
- **Weekly circles**: 1.5-2 hours for 6-8 weeks
- **Bi-weekly circles**: 2-2.5 hours for 8-10 weeks  
- **Monthly intensives**: 3-4 hours once per month for 4-6 months

**Find Your Space**
- **Schools**: Classrooms, libraries, student centers
- **Community**: Libraries, community centers, faith spaces, parks
- **Homes**: Living rooms (for smaller, informal circles)
- **Online**: Zoom, Google Meet, or other platforms with breakout rooms

**Gather Basic Supplies**
- Flip chart paper and markers
- Sticky notes
- Name tags
- Timer or phone
- Snacks and drinks
- Talking piece (see below)

### **Step 3: Recruit Participants (Week 3)**

**Aim for Diversity**
Try to include people with different:
- Cultural backgrounds and identities
- Perspectives on the issues you'll discuss
- Levels of experience with activism/community work
- Ages (within your target range)
- Communication styles (talkative and quieter people)

**Recruitment Strategies**
- **Personal invitation**: Start with friends, then ask them to invite others
- **Social media**: Post in relevant groups and ask people to share
- **Flyers**: In schools, community centers, coffee shops
- **Community organizations**: Partner with existing youth groups
- **Teachers/adults**: Ask trusted adults to help spread the word

**Invitation Message Template**
```
Hi! I'm starting a youth dialogue circle to explore [your topic]. We'll meet [frequency] for [duration] to share our experiences, listen to different perspectives, and develop action projects together.

This is a space for:
‚ú® Honest conversation across difference
‚ú® Learning from each other's experiences  
‚ú® Developing solutions we can actually implement
‚ú® Building authentic relationships

No experience necessary - just bring curiosity and willingness to listen!

Interested? Reply with questions or let me know you'd like to join.
```

**Optimal Group Size**
- **Small circles**: 6-8 people (more intimate, easier to manage)
- **Large circles**: 10-12 people (more diverse perspectives, requires more skill)

### **Step 4: Prepare Yourself as Facilitator (Week 4)**

**Develop Core Facilitation Skills**

**Deep Listening**
- Pay attention to both words and emotions
- Notice when someone seems to have more to say
- Resist the urge to immediately respond or fix
- Ask clarifying questions: "Can you tell me more about that?"

**Creating Safety**
- Set clear agreements about confidentiality
- Interrupt respectfully when conversations become heated
- Ensure everyone gets heard, not just the loudest voices
- Model vulnerability by sharing your own experiences

**Managing Group Dynamics**
- Notice who's talking and who isn't
- Gently redirect when conversations go off-topic
- Know how to handle conflict constructively
- Keep track of time while allowing for organic flow

**Practice These Phrases**
- "Thank you for sharing that. Who else has thoughts on this?"
- "I'm noticing we're getting into debate mode. Let's step back and listen to understand."
- "It seems like there's strong feeling about this. Can we slow down and hear from everyone?"
- "What I'm hearing is... Is that right?"
- "Let's take a breath together."

**Prepare for Challenges**
- **Someone dominates the conversation**: "Thank you, [name]. Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."
- **Conflict arises**: "I see we have different perspectives here. Let's get curious about those differences."
- **Silence feels uncomfortable**: "Silence is okay. Take time to think."
- **Someone gets emotional**: "Thank you for trusting us with your feelings. Would you like to say more or shall we move on?"

### **Step 5: Design Your First Session (Week 4)**

**Session 1 Agenda Template (2 hours)**

**Opening Circle (20 minutes)**
- Welcome and introductions
- Share hopes and concerns for the circle
- Review agreements and guidelines

**Relationship Building (30 minutes)**
- Pair sharing: "Tell your partner about a time when you felt really heard by someone"
- Report back key insights to the whole group

**Topic Introduction (40 minutes)**
- Present the issue/question you'll be exploring
- Initial round: "What's your personal connection to this topic?"
- Clarify what you'll explore in future sessions

**Action Visioning (20 minutes)**
- Small groups: "If this circle is wildly successful, what will be different in our community 6 months from now?"
- Share visions with the whole group

**Closing Circle (10 minutes)**
- Each person shares one word describing how they're feeling
- Confirm next meeting time and any preparation needed

## üåà Creating the Container: Agreements and Guidelines

### **Essential Circle Agreements**

**Confidentiality**
"What's shared here, stays here. Stories and insights can be shared, but not who said what."

**Own Your Experience** 
"Speak from 'I' statements rather than generalizing about others or groups."

**Listen with Curiosity**
"Try to understand rather than convince. Ask questions to learn more."

**Space for All Voices**
"Step up if you tend to be quiet, step back if you tend to talk a lot."

**Expect and Accept Non-Closure**
"We won't solve everything today. Some conversations will continue."

**Care for Yourself and Others**
"Take breaks when you need them. Speak up if something doesn't feel right."

### **Advanced Agreements for Diverse Groups**

**Honor Different Communication Styles**
"Some of us process by talking, others by listening. Both are valuable."

**Name Impact Over Intent**
"If something lands wrong, we'll address the impact even if the intent was good."

**Cultural Humility**
"We may not understand everyone's background. We'll ask respectful questions and share our own experiences."

**Brave Space, Not Safe Space**
"We'll take risks to grow together, knowing that growth can be uncomfortable."

### **Using a Talking Piece**

A talking piece is an object that indicates who has the floor to speak. Choose something meaningful:
- ü™® A stone from your local area
- üå± A plant or flower
- üé® Something created by a group member
- üìø A meaningful object from different cultures represented

**How It Works:**
- Only the person holding the talking piece speaks
- Others listen without interrupting
- Speaker can pass it when they're done or ready for responses
- Anyone can request the talking piece by raising their hand

## üí¨ Facilitation Techniques for Deeper Dialogue

### **Opening and Closing Rituals**

**Opening Options**
- **Moment of silence**: 30 seconds to center and arrive
- **Weather check**: Each person shares how they're feeling using weather metaphors
- **Gratitude round**: Quick sharing of something each person is grateful for
- **Intention setting**: "What do you hope to give and receive today?"

**Closing Options**
- **Word/phrase check-out**: One word describing how you're leaving
- **Appreciation circle**: Acknowledge something specific you appreciated about the session
- **Commitment round**: Share one thing you'll think about or do before next time
- **Group breath**: Three deep breaths together

### **Dialogue Formats for Different Purposes**

**For Building Understanding: Listening Circles**
- Pose a question
- Go around the circle with each person sharing (no responses)
- Second round for anyone who wants to add more
- Reflect on themes and insights heard

*Example questions:*
- "What's a story that shaped how you see this issue?"
- "Describe a time when your opinion changed about something important."

**For Exploring Complexity: Fishbowl**
- 4-5 people sit in inner circle discussing the topic
- Others observe from outer circle
- Anyone can tap in by touching someone's shoulder
- Creates dynamic conversation with built-in reflection

**For Decision-Making: Consensus Building**
- Present the decision to be made
- Clarifying questions only (no opinions yet)
- Discussion of options and concerns
- Test for consensus: "Can everyone live with this decision?"
- Address concerns and modify until you reach agreement

**For Action Planning: Open Space**
- Post big questions on walls around the room
- People move between conversations as interests shift
- Capture key insights on flip charts
- Report back and identify next steps

### **Handling Difficult Moments**

**When Someone Shares Something Heavy**
- Thank them for their trust
- Ask if they need anything right now
- Check if they want responses or just to be heard
- Don't try to fix or minimize their experience

**When Conflict Emerges**
- Slow down and breathe
- Acknowledge the tension: "I'm noticing some strong feelings here"
- Ask each person to share their perspective without interruption
- Look for underlying needs or values they share
- Take a break if needed

**When Energy Drops**
- Notice body language and engagement
- Call for a stretch break or movement
- Change format (small groups, pairs, walking)
- Check in about what's needed

**When Someone Says Something Harmful**
- Don't ignore it or pretend it didn't happen
- Address impact: "I want to pause here because that comment landed hard for some folks"
- Give space for people to respond
- Return to agreements and ground rules
- Follow up privately with both the speaker and those affected

## üéâ Celebrating Success

Remember that success in dialogue circles isn't just about the big policy changes or media attention you might get. Success also looks like:

- **A quiet person** finding their voice and speaking up for the first time
- **Two people** who disagreed strongly at the beginning becoming friends
- **Someone** changing their mind about an important issue
- **The group** learning to handle conflict with respect and care
- **Participants** taking initiative to organize their own projects
- **Community members** saying they feel more heard and valued
- **You** developing skills and confidence you didn't know you had

Every authentic conversation, every moment of real listening, every bridge built across difference is a victory worth celebrating.

Your work matters. Your voice matters. The world needs the unique combination of wisdom, energy, and hope that young people bring to the challenges we face together.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. And remember - you don't have to be perfect to make a difference.

**The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.**
