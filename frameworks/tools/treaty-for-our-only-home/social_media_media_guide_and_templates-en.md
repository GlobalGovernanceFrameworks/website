The climate crisis isn't just an environmental issue; it's a failure of international law. We lack the tools to hold the biggest polluters accountable for large-scale environmental destruction.

## Template 3: On Fiscal Responsibility & Climate Finance
*(To be used with the graphic about the cost of inaction)*

The debate over climate action often misses the most important point: the cost of inaction is catastrophic. We are facing trillions in damages.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" presents a fiscally responsible path forward. By implementing tools like a global carbon tax, we can create sustainable, independent funding for the solutions that ensure our collective survival. This isn't just a moral imperative; it's a sound investment in a stable future.

## Template 4: On Democratic Legitimacy
*(To be used with this graphic about the Global Citizens' Initiative)*

### For LinkedIn / Facebook:

Many people feel that global decisions are made without their input. This democratic deficit fuels distrust and hinders collective action.

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" tackles this head-on. The proposed "Global Citizens' Initiative" empowers as few as 10 million people from across the world to bring binding referendums to the global stage. This is a powerful step towards a more legitimate, participatory, and democratic world.

What if 10 million citizens could demand a global vote on climate?
