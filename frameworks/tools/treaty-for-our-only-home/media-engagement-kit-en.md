# Media Engagement Kit: Treaty for Our Only Home

**Objective**: This kit provides core messaging and templates to help advocates, partners, and civil society organizations communicate effectively and consistently about the "Treaty for Our Only Home."

## Part 1: Core Messaging Guide & Talking Points

Use these points as the foundation for interviews, op-eds, and all public communication.

### The One-Sentence Pitch

The "Treaty for Our Only Home" is a comprehensive, ready-to-implement framework designed to upgrade our outdated global governance systems to solve the 21st century's interconnected crises of climate change, pandemics, and economic instability.

### The Problem: The Global Polycrisis

- **Start with the shared pain**: "Humanity faces a 'polycrisis'—cascading failures in our climate, economic, and political systems that our current institutions were not designed to handle."

- **Make it tangible with data**: "The cost of inaction is catastrophic and quantifiable. Authoritative sources project we are facing $54 trillion in climate-related damages and have already lost nearly $14 trillion to a single pandemic. Sticking with the status quo is financially and morally unsustainable."

- **The core diagnosis**: "These aren't separate problems; they are symptoms of a single, underlying issue: our global governance is dangerously outdated."

### The Solution: An Operating System Upgrade

- **Use the metaphor**: "Think of the treaty as an operating system upgrade for the world. Our current OS was built for the 20th century; it's slow, full of security holes, and can't run the apps we need to survive the 21st."

- **Focus on what it does**: "This framework transforms global governance from a system that generates crises into one that generates resilience. It unlocks global action on climate, prevents future pandemics, and builds an economy that serves everyone."

- **It is not from scratch**: "This isn't a utopian fantasy. It is a work of synthesis, integrating proven governance mechanisms, established principles in international law, and systems thinking into a single, coherent plan."

### The Keystone Reforms (Focus on 3 for simplicity)

When asked "How?", focus on the most impactful and easy-to-understand reforms detailed in the treaty.

1. **"First, it fixes the gridlock in global security. By reforming the UN Security Council veto, we can take decisive action on climate and humanitarian crises without one country holding the world hostage."**

2. **"Second, it holds polluters accountable. By establishing 'Ecocide' as an international crime, we create a powerful deterrent against the large-scale destruction of our planet—the very ecosystems we all depend on."**

3. **"Third, it creates sustainable funding. Through mechanisms like a global carbon tax, we can fund the solutions to our biggest challenges—like climate adaptation and pandemic preparedness—without relying solely on the political whims of individual nations."**

### The Call to Action: Pragmatic & Visionary

- **For governments**: "We are calling for a 'Global Stewardship Alliance'—a coalition of 30-50 forward-thinking nations to lead by example and pilot these reforms."

- **For the public**: "This isn't just for politicians. This is a toolkit for every citizen. Go to globalgovernanceframework.org, learn about the framework, and use the tools we've provided to demand that your representatives choose cooperation over competition."
