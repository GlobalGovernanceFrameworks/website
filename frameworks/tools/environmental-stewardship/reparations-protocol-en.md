## Introduction

The Reparations Protocol establishes principles, processes, and practices for addressing historical and ongoing environmental and technological harms. It creates pathways toward healing relationships between human communities, technological systems, and ecosystems that have been damaged through extractive practices, cultural erasure, or technological exploitation.

As a core implementation tool of the Environmental Stewardship Framework, this protocol recognizes that transformative environmental governance requires accountability for past and present harms. By integrating restorative justice approaches with ecological understanding and technological ethics, it provides a structured methodology for identifying, assessing, and addressing various forms of harm within the framework's governance scope.

This protocol serves multiple purposes:
- Creating accountability when governance structures cause harm
- Addressing historical environmental injustices affecting communities and ecosystems
- Establishing processes for technological harm remediation
- Ensuring lessons from harmful practices inform governance evolution
- Building trust through demonstrated commitment to justice and repair

Through this protocol, the Environmental Stewardship Framework acknowledges that genuine stewardship requires not only forward-looking vision but also healing of damaged relationships and systems. By allocating resources, attention, and authority to reparative processes, the framework demonstrates its commitment to justice as a foundation for regenerative environmental governance.

## Reparations Framework

The Reparations Protocol recognizes diverse forms of harm requiring different approaches to assessment, remedy, and healing. This framework establishes the underlying structure for all reparative processes within the Environmental Stewardship Framework.

- Long-term commitment rather than one-time interventions was necessary
- Connection between environmental harm and cultural impact required attention
- Multi-stakeholder governance enabled balanced implementation

### Technology Data Extraction Reparations - East Africa

**Case Study (Fictive)**: A large technology corporation deployed environmental monitoring systems across East African community lands without adequate consent, extracting valuable ecological data while creating energy burdens. The reparations process included:

- Data repatriation to community ownership with benefit-sharing agreements
- Investment in renewable energy infrastructure to offset system impacts
- Training and employment for community members in technology management
- Co-design of ethical protocols for future monitoring initiatives
- Financial compensation for extracted knowledge value
- Support for community-led innovation using returned data

- Economic dimensions created sustainable path forward
- Legal protection prevented repeat harm patterns
- Community leadership ensured culturally appropriate approaches
- Balance between past-oriented repair and future-oriented opportunity was achieved

### Regional Hub Misconduct Resolution - Amazon Region

**Case Study (Fictive)**: A Regional Hub implemented under the Environmental Stewardship Framework systematically excluded indigenous perspectives on forest management, leading to inappropriate technology deployment and disruption of traditional stewardship. The reparations process involved:

- Dissolution of the hub with asset redistribution
- 20% of assets allocated to specific reparation initiatives
- Formation of a new governance structure with 50% indigenous leadership
- Documentation of traditional forest management practices
- Support for intergenerational knowledge transmission
- Revision of framework implementation protocols

The Reparations Protocol provides a systematic approach to addressing historical and ongoing harms within the Environmental Stewardship Framework. By establishing clear processes for identification, assessment, allocation, and documentation, it creates pathways toward healing relationships between human communities, technological systems, and ecosystems that have been damaged.

This protocol demonstrates the framework's commitment to justice as a foundation for regenerative environmental governance. Through thoughtful implementation of these reparative measures, the Environmental Stewardship Framework builds trust, accountability, and resilience while modeling the principles of justice it seeks to promote.

Through measurable outcomes, including 4,000 tCO2e/year in carbon savings and significant ecosystem restoration, the protocol contributes concretely to the framework's transformative vision while addressing the legacies of harm that might otherwise undermine progress toward a regenerative world.
