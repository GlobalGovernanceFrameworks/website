## Introduction

The Ecosystem Health Indicators provide a structured framework for monitoring ecosystem integrity, function, and resilience across diverse contexts. This tool integrates scientific metrics with traditional ecological knowledge to create holistic assessment systems that respect multiple ways of knowing while providing rigorous, comparable data for governance decisions.

By establishing clear indicators that bridge Western scientific and indigenous knowledge systems, this tool supports implementation of the Environmental Stewardship Framework's core principles of sustainability, science-based decision-making, inclusivity, and adaptability. The indicators enable communities to track ecosystem changes, evaluate governance effectiveness, and make evidence-based decisions about stewardship approaches.

The Ecosystem Health Indicators provide a practical framework for monitoring ecosystem conditions through complementary knowledge systems. By respecting both scientific and traditional approaches to understanding ecological health, these indicators support governance decisions that honor multiple ways of knowing while providing rigorous evidence for adaptive management.

Through collaborative implementation, these indicators become powerful tools for community-led environmental stewardship, creating data that bridges diverse knowledge systems while respecting data sovereignty and cultural protocols. When integrated with governance systems, they enable timely, informed decisions that protect ecosystem integrity while supporting human-nature relationships.
