# Community Equity Model Template
## Building Community Wealth Through Democratic Water Ownership

### üåä Overview

The Community Equity Model transforms water infrastructure from extractive investment into community wealth-building opportunity. Rather than creating dependencies on external utilities or private companies, this model enables communities to own, control, and benefit from their water systems while ensuring universal access and environmental sustainability.

**Core Innovation**: Combines cooperative ownership principles with innovative equity structures that build community wealth while maintaining affordability and universal access for all community members.

**Key Principles**:
- **Democratic Ownership**: Community members own and control water infrastructure
- **Universal Access**: Ownership structure ensures no one is excluded from water access
- **Wealth Building**: Infrastructure investment builds community assets and equity
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Ownership incentivizes long-term sustainability
- **Economic Justice**: Profits stay in community rather than extracting to external shareholders

## üí∞ Financial Structure and Equity Building

### **Capitalization Strategy**

**Initial Investment Sources**:

| Source | Percentage | Form | Community Control |
|--------|------------|------|------------------|
| **Community Contributions** | 30% | Cash, labor, materials | Full democratic control |
| **Public Investment** | 25% | Grants, low-interest loans | Community ownership maintained |
| **Solidarity Finance** | 20% | Community loan funds, credit unions | Community accountability |
| **Patient Capital** | 15% | Impact investors, foundations | Limited returns, no control |
| **Cooperative Networks** | 10% | Inter-cooperative investment | Mutual support agreements |

**Equity Growth Mechanisms**:

**Infrastructure Value Appreciation**:
- **Asset Building**: Infrastructure improvements increase total cooperative value
- **Efficiency Gains**: Technology and process improvements reduce costs and increase surplus
- **Expanded Services**: Additional services (internet, energy) increase revenue streams
- **Regional Integration**: Network effects with other cooperatives increase collective value

**Community Wealth Multiplier Effects**:
- **Local Employment**: Community members employed in construction, maintenance, management
- **Local Procurement**: Equipment and materials purchased from local businesses when possible
- **Skill Development**: Training and certification building individual and community capacity
- **Innovation Revenue**: Community-developed solutions licensed to other communities

### **Affordability and Access Mechanisms**

**Progressive Pricing Structure**:

| **Household Use** (50-200L/day) | $15-30 | Cost recovery | Standard equity growth |
| **Comfort Use** (200-400L/day) | $40-80 | Contributes to subsidy fund | Enhanced equity participation |
| **High Use** (400L+/day) | $100+ | Major subsidy contribution | Premium equity and community investment |

**Alternative Payment Methods**:
- **Sweat Equity**: 4 hours monthly maintenance = $20 credit
- **Community Service**: Teaching, organizing, advocacy = payment credits
