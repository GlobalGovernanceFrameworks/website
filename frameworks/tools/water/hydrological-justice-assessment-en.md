# Hydrological Justice Assessment Framework
## Measuring Systemic Equity and Ecosystem Health in Water Governance

### üåä Assessment Overview

The Hydrological Justice Assessment provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating whether water governance systems serve justice, equity, and planetary healing. Unlike traditional water assessments that focus on technical performance, this tool examines root causes of water injustice while measuring progress toward transformative governance that serves both communities and ecosystems.

**Core Purpose**: Systematically assess how well water governance addresses historical inequities, current injustices, and future sustainability while building community power and healing damaged relationships between humans and water systems.

**Assessment Philosophy**:
- **Systemic Analysis**: Examines root causes rather than symptoms of water challenges
- **Intersectional Approach**: Considers how multiple forms of oppression interact in water systems
- **Community-Controlled**: Communities lead assessment and determine how results are used
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Evaluates health of both human and more-than-human water relationships
- **Transformative Orientation**: Measures progress toward justice rather than just access

## üåü Call to Assessment Action

The Hydrological Justice Assessment is more than an evaluation tool‚Äîit's a process of community empowerment, consciousness building, and strategic planning for water transformation. By systematically examining how well water governance serves justice, equity, and planetary healing, communities build the knowledge and power needed to demand and create change.

**Your Assessment Journey Begins With**:
- **Recognition** that your community deserves water justice and has the knowledge to evaluate progress
- **Commitment** to systematic documentation of both challenges and community strengths
- **Courage** to name injustices clearly while building vision for transformation
- **Collective Action** that uses assessment results to organize for concrete change

**Assessment as Sacred Work**: Evaluating water justice is sacred work because it honors the relationships between communities, ecosystems, and water systems while documenting both wounds and healing. Approach assessment with reverence for community knowledge, respect for water as living entity, and commitment to justice as spiritual practice.

**Global Learning Network**: Join communities worldwide using this assessment framework to measure and advance water justice. Share your experiences, adapt tools to your context, and contribute to the global movement transforming water governance from extraction to regeneration.
