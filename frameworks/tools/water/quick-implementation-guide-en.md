## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-6)

### Step 1: Form Your Community Water Circle (Month 1)

**Start Small and Inclusive**: Begin with 5-8 committed community members representing diverse perspectives including women, youth, elders, and different community areas or groups.

**Essential Participants**:
- Community leaders (formal and informal)
- Women who collect or manage household water
- Youth who can bring energy and innovation
- Elders with traditional knowledge and wisdom
- Representatives from different neighborhoods or groups

**First Meeting Agenda**:
1. **Share Water Stories** (30 minutes): Each person shares their water challenges and hopes
2. **Map Community Water** (45 minutes): Draw simple map of water sources, problems, and assets
3. **Identify Priorities** (30 minutes): What are the most urgent water needs?
4. **Plan Next Steps** (15 minutes): When will you meet again and who else should join?

**Tools You Need**: Large paper, markers, snacks for sharing, and community space for meeting

### Step 2: Conduct Community Water Assessment (Month 2)

**Simple Community Mapping**: Work together to document:
- **Water Sources**: Where does your community get water? (wells, springs, pipes, rivers)
- **Water Quality**: What are the quality problems? (taste, smell, color, sickness)
- **Access Issues**: Who has trouble getting water? (distance, cost, discrimination)
- **Existing Assets**: What water infrastructure and knowledge already exists?
- **Decision-Making**: Who makes decisions about water in your community?

**Community Conversations**: Hold informal discussions in different community spaces to gather broader input:
- Markets, schools, religious centers, workplaces
- Women's groups, youth groups, elder gatherings
- Different neighborhoods or community sections

**Documentation**: Keep simple records of what you learn using notebooks, photos, or recordings that community members can easily understand and access.

### Step 3: Build Knowledge and Skills (Month 3)

**Learn Together**: Organize learning sessions on topics your community identifies as priorities:
