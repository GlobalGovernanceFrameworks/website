# Emergency WASH Response Protocols
## Rapid Deployment for Community-Controlled Crisis Response

### üö® Overview

Emergency WASH Response Protocols provide systematic frameworks for rapidly deploying water, sanitation, and hygiene services during crises while maintaining community leadership, cultural sensitivity, and building toward long-term resilience. These protocols prioritize community agency, trauma-informed approaches, and build-back-better principles that strengthen rather than undermine community capacity.

**Core Innovation**: Combines rapid emergency response with community empowerment, ensuring immediate needs are met while building community capacity for long-term water governance and resilience.

**Key Principles**:
- **Community Leadership**: Local communities lead response with external support, not external control
- **Trauma-Informed Approach**: Recognition of crisis impacts on mental health and community wellbeing
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect for cultural practices, spiritual needs, and traditional knowledge
- **Build-Back-Better**: Recovery that creates more resilient and equitable systems
- **Dignified Response**: Maintaining human dignity and agency throughout crisis response
