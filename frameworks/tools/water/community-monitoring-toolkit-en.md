# Community Monitoring Toolkit for Water Governance
## Empowering Communities as Water Stewards and Evaluators

### üåä Toolkit Overview

This toolkit provides comprehensive guidance for communities to monitor, evaluate, and improve their own water governance systems. Designed to strengthen community agency while generating valuable data for advocacy and improvement, it bridges traditional knowledge with citizen science to create accountability systems that serve community empowerment.

**Core Purpose**: Enable communities to become the primary evaluators of their water systems' performance, governance effectiveness, and environmental health while building capacity for advocacy and continuous improvement.

**Key Principles**:
- **Community Ownership**: Communities control what is monitored, how data is collected, and how results are used
- **Cultural Integration**: Monitoring approaches that honor traditional knowledge and community values
- **Action-Oriented**: Data collection that directly supports community decision-making and advocacy
- **Accessible Methods**: Simple, affordable tools that any community member can learn and use
- **Rights-Based Framework**: Monitoring grounded in human rights and environmental justice
