# Power Analysis Toolkit for Water Governance
## Building Community Power for Water Justice

### üåä Overview

This toolkit provides systematic methods for analyzing power relationships in water governance, building coalitions, and developing strategies that center community voices while advancing water justice. Designed for community organizers, water advocates, and grassroots leaders working to transform water systems from extraction to regeneration.

**Core Purpose**: Map who has power over water decisions, identify opportunities for building community influence, and develop strategic approaches for advancing water justice through collective action.

## üìä Step 2: Power and Influence Assessment

### **Power Mapping Grid**

Create a visual map using two axes:
- **Vertical Axis**: Level of Influence (High to Low)
- **Horizontal Axis**: Position on Issue (Strongly Opposed to Strongly Supportive)

**Quadrant Analysis**:

**High Influence + Supportive** (Champions):
- Your strongest allies with significant power
- Ask them to publicly advocate and use their influence
- Connect them with other supporters to amplify impact
- Support their leadership and provide resources

**High Influence + Neutral** (Persuadables):
- Key targets for conversion efforts
- Research their interests, values, and pressure points
- Develop tailored approaches based on their motivations
- Build relationships before making direct asks

**High Influence + Opposed** (Opponents):
- May need to be neutralized or worked around
- Understand their opposition sources and motivations
- Look for common ground or ways to reduce their influence
- Prepare counter-strategies and alternative pathways

**Low Influence + Supportive** (Base Building):
- Your grassroots base for organizing and mobilization
- Organize them for collective action and voice
- Build their capacity and leadership skills
- Connect them with higher-influence allies

### **Influence Network Analysis**

**Relationship Mapping**:
- Draw lines between stakeholders who have relationships
- Identify clusters of connected allies and opponents
- Find bridges between different groups or communities
