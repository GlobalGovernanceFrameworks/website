# Conflict-Sensitive WASH Guidelines
## Peace-Building Through Water and Sanitation Programming

### 🕊️ Overview

Conflict-Sensitive WASH Guidelines provide comprehensive frameworks for implementing water and sanitation programs that contribute to peace-building, conflict prevention, and social cohesion while addressing immediate WASH needs. These guidelines recognize that water programming can either exacerbate tensions or build bridges between communities, and provides tools to ensure programming serves peace and justice.

**Core Innovation**: Integrates conflict analysis, peace-building, and community reconciliation directly into WASH programming design and implementation, transforming essential services into platforms for building sustainable peace.

**Key Principles**:
- **Do No Harm**: WASH programming that avoids exacerbating conflicts or creating new tensions
- **Peace-Building Integration**: Water and sanitation projects as opportunities for cooperation and reconciliation
- **Community Agency**: Local communities lead peace-building processes with WASH support
- **Equity and Justice**: Addressing root causes of conflict through equitable resource access
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect for diverse cultural approaches to conflict resolution and peace
