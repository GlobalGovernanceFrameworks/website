**Case Study (Real)**: **Patagonia's Traditional Knowledge Partnership Model** demonstrates successful corporate transformation through authentic indigenous partnership. Patagonia's collaboration with indigenous communities for sustainable material sourcing includes fair compensation for traditional knowledge, community verification of environmental claims, and long-term partnership agreements that strengthen traditional governance systems. The partnership increased community economic sovereignty by 200% while improving supply chain sustainability, demonstrating profitable corporate transformation through genuine community partnership.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Amazon Corporate Redemption Initiative** (2029-2032) successfully demonstrated extractive industry transformation when a major mining company partnered with 50 indigenous communities across Brazil, Peru, and Colombia to transition from extraction to restoration operations. Using traditional knowledge licensing agreements, community-controlled implementation, and indigenous governance oversight, the initiative generated $500M in community economic benefits while restoring 100,000 hectares of degraded land, demonstrating profitable corporate transformation through traditional authority partnership and community sovereignty respect.
