This template provides a structured approach to design and implement a Public Trust Dashboard for real-time monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity restoration projects, ensuring transparency, community control, and accountability. Aligned with the Global Governance Biodiversity Implementation Framework’s Implementation and Economic Transformation Pillars, it supports FPIC 2.0 protocols, blockchain integration, and cultural mobilization initiatives like #BioDebt. The template includes tools, metrics, and examples to guide stakeholders in achieving measurable biodiversity and social outcomes.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The **Public Trust Dashboard & Evaluation Template** is a resource designed to enable indigenous communities, Regional Biodiversity Hubs, and global stakeholders to monitor and evaluate biodiversity restoration projects transparently. It addresses the framework’s call for accountability by providing real-time data on fund allocation, ecological outcomes, and community benefits, secured by blockchain and verified by community audits. Key objectives include:

- **Transparency**: Ensure 100% of biodiversity project data is publicly accessible by 2030.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Empower 70% indigenous-led dashboard governance via FPIC 2.0 protocols.
- **Community Engagement**: Reach 5M users annually through dashboard-linked campaigns like #BioDebt by 2035.
- **Biodiversity Impact**: Track 15% ecosystem recovery in target areas linked to dashboard-monitored projects by 2035.

**Purpose**: To provide actionable tools for deploying a Public Trust Dashboard that fosters trust, accountability, and biodiversity restoration.

**Primary Users**: Indigenous councils, Regional Biodiversity Hubs, technical teams, policymakers, youth representatives.

**Integration**: Complements the [Biodiversity Blockchain Setup Guide](/frameworks/tools/biodiversity/biodiversity-blockchain-setup-guide-en.pdf), [Biodiversity Impact Bonds Template](/frameworks/tools/biodiversity/impact-bonds-financing-en.pdf), and [Bio-Influencer Training & Campaign Kit](/frameworks/tools/biodiversity/bio-influencer-training-campaign-kit-en.pdf).

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study (Fictive)

**Case Study (Fictive)**: Amazon Public Trust Dashboard

In 2032, a Public Trust Dashboard was launched in the Amazon Basin, co-governed by Yanomami and Kayapó councils. The dashboard tracked $15M in Biodiversity Impact Bonds for reforestation, displaying real-time fund flows (60% to community UBES systems) and a 20% forest cover increase. Integrated with #BioDebt, it engaged 1M users and reported 100% transaction transparency via blockchain. Restoration Festival updates boosted engagement, with 2M social media impressions. This example demonstrates the power of community-led dashboards in ensuring transparency and biodiversity outcomes.

## <a id="risk-mitigation"></a>Risk Mitigation

Risks are managed to protect community interests and ensure dashboard reliability.

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data inaccuracies | Medium | High | Blockchain-secured data and triangulated verification; regular audits. |
| Community exclusion | Low | High | FPIC 2.0 protocols and 70% indigenous governance; Justice Translators. |
| Cybersecurity threats | Medium | High | End-to-end encryption and regular security audits; contingency protocols. |
| Low user engagement | Medium | Medium | #BioDebt widgets and Restoration Festival integration; youth-led campaigns. |

**Contingency Measures**:
- **Emergency Fund**: 5% of funds ($50,000–$500,000) reserved for crises (e.g., data breaches, system failures).
- **Community Recall**: Indigenous veto power to pause dashboard operations if cultural or ecological harm occurs.
- **Rapid Response**: 72-hour deployment of technical teams for system failures or mediators for disputes.
