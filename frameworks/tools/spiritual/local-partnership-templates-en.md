# Local Partnership MOU Template

## Purpose
The Local Partnership MOU Template provides a customizable framework for formalizing agreements between dialogue organizers and local stakeholders (e.g., spiritual communities, NGOs, youth organizations, educational institutions) within the Religious & Spiritual Dialogue Framework. It ensures collaborative, inclusive, and equitable partnerships to support interfaith and inter-spiritual dialogues, fostering mutual understanding and collective action on shared governance challenges.

## Intended Audience
- Dialogue facilitators coordinating local, regional, or global dialogue initiatives
- Community leaders, spiritual practitioners, and organizations partnering in dialogues
- Regional Hubs and the Global Council for Religious & Spiritual Dialogue (GCRSD) overseeing partnership agreements

## Core Principles
This template aligns with the framework’s five core principles:
1. **Inclusivity**: Ensuring diverse stakeholders, including marginalized groups, are equitably represented in partnerships.
2. **Respect**: Honoring the cultural, spiritual, and organizational boundaries of all partners.
3. **Equity**: Addressing power imbalances to ensure fair contributions and benefits.
4. **Collaboration**: Promoting shared goals and mutual accountability in dialogue initiatives.
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Valuing spiritual and community wisdom as integral to partnership outcomes.

## Template Overview
The MOU template includes:
- **Preamble**: Context and purpose of the partnership.
- **Parties Involved**: Identification of signatories and their roles.
- **Objectives**: Shared goals of the partnership.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Specific commitments of each partner.
- **Resources and Support**: Contributions (e.g., funding, venues, expertise).

- **Duration and Termination**: Timeline and conditions for ending the agreement.
- **Signatures**: Formal acknowledgment by all parties.

## Customization Guidelines
- **Cultural Sensitivity**:
  - Adapt language to local norms (e.g., use “collaboration agreement” instead of “MOU” in oral-tradition communities).
  - Example: In a Pacific Islands partnership, emphasize communal values like reciprocity in the preamble.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Provide the MOU in accessible formats (e.g., audio, large print, translated versions) per the [Digital Access & Inclusion Audit](/frameworks/tools/spiritual/digital-access-inclusion-audit-en.pdf).
  - Example: Offer a verbal MOU explanation for low-literacy rural partners in Africa.
- **Youth Engagement**:
  - Include youth organizations as partners, assigning them roles like outreach or feedback collection.
  - Example: In a European partnership, involve a youth interfaith group to recruit young participants.
- **Remote and Rural Engagement**:
  - Ensure rural partners can sign MOUs offline (e.g., via community leaders) and access virtual dialogues through mobile data support.
  - Example: In a Central Asian partnership, deliver MOU copies to nomadic communities via local intermediaries.
- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Ensure consent for all commitments, respecting partners’ capacity and boundaries.
  - Use the [Cultural Appropriation Prevention Checklist](/frameworks/tools/spiritual/cultural-appropriation-prevention-en.pdf) to guide partner contributions.
