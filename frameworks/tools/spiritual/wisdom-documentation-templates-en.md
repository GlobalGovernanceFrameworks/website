# Wisdom Documentation Templates

## Purpose
The Wisdom Documentation Templates are designed to provide facilitators with structured, customizable tools to ethically record and preserve the insights, spiritual wisdom, and outcomes from interfaith and inter-spiritual dialogues within the Religious & Spiritual Dialogue Framework. These templates ensure that sacred knowledge, narratives, and collaborative actions are documented respectfully, with consent, and in alignment with the framework’s principles of inclusivity, respect, equity, collaboration, and knowledge integration, enabling future learning and sharing.

## Intended Audience
- Facilitators documenting global summits, regional workshops, or local dialogue circles
- Community leaders, spiritual practitioners, and archivists preserving dialogue outcomes
- Regional Hubs and the Global Council for Religious & Spiritual Dialogue (GCRSD) managing knowledge repositories

## Core Principles
This tool aligns with the framework’s five core principles:
1. **Inclusivity**: Ensuring documentation reflects diverse voices, especially marginalized ones.
2. **Respect**: Honoring the sacredness and boundaries of shared wisdom and narratives.
3. **Equity**: Prioritizing contributions from underrepresented groups to address power imbalances.
4. **Collaboration**: Engaging communities in co-creating and validating documented content.
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Valuing spiritual and cultural wisdom as central to dialogue outcomes.

## Templates Overview
The Wisdom Documentation Templates include:
- **Dialogue Summary Template**: Captures key insights, participants, and outcomes.
- **Narrative Capture Template**: Records personal or communal stories and spiritual teachings.
- **Action Plan Template**: Documents collaborative commitments and follow-up plans.
- **Consent and Permissions Template**: Ensures ethical use of sacred knowledge.
- **Customization Guidelines**: Adapts templates to regional and cultural contexts.

**Customization Notes**:

- Adapt restrictions to sacred protocols (e.g., no photography of rituals).

## Customization Guidelines
- **Cultural Sensitivity**:
  - Adapt documentation to local norms (e.g., oral recordings in Indigenous contexts, written summaries in formal settings).
  - Example: In an African dialogue, use audio narratives for Akan oral traditions, per elder guidance.
- **Power Dynamics**:
  - Prioritize narratives and actions from marginalized groups (e.g., Indigenous, youth, women), per the [Representation Assessment Tool](/frameworks/tools/spiritual/representation-assessment-tool-en.pdf).
  - Example: In a South Asian dialogue, center Dalit contributions in summaries.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Provide templates in accessible formats (e.g., audio, braille, translations), per the [Digital Access & Inclusion Audit](/frameworks/tools/spiritual/digital-access-inclusion-audit-en.pdf).
  - Example: In a Central Asian dialogue, offer Kyrgyz audio summaries for nomadic communities.
- **Youth Engagement**:
  - Include youth voices in narratives and action plans, assigning them documentation roles (e.g., summarizing insights).
  - Example: In a European dialogue, engage youth to document secular humanist perspectives.
- **Remote and Rural Engagement**:
  - Use offline formats (e.g., printed templates, verbal recordings) for rural participants with limited digital access.
  - Example: In an African dialogue, distribute printed action plans via community leaders.
- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Ensure informed consent and respect sacred boundaries, per the [Cultural Appropriation Prevention Checklist](/frameworks/tools/spiritual/cultural-appropriation-prevention-en.pdf).
  - Example: In an Australian dialogue, secure Aboriginal elder consent for documenting Dreamtime stories.
- **Trauma Sensitivity**:
  - Handle narratives of historical wounds with care, per the [Truth & Reconciliation Toolkit](/frameworks/tools/spiritual/truth-reconciliation-toolkit-en.pdf).
  - Example: In a Latin American dialogue, anonymize Indigenous trauma narratives unless explicit consent is given.
