# Sentience Assessment Framework
## Global Guardian Framework Scientific Tool

## Purpose and Overview

This framework provides systematic, evidence-based protocols for assessing animal sentience to inform Global Guardian Framework protection tier assignments. The assessment prioritizes scientific rigor while acknowledging uncertainty and applying precautionary principles to prevent suffering in potentially sentient beings.

**Scientific Foundation:**
- **Evidence-Based Methodology**: All assessments must be grounded in peer-reviewed scientific research
- **Precautionary Principle**: When evidence suggests possible sentience, protective measures are applied while further research proceeds
- **Transparency**: All assessment criteria, evidence, and reasoning are publicly documented
- **Adaptive Framework**: Classifications update as scientific understanding advances
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Integration of neuroscience, behavioral ecology, comparative psychology, and evolutionary biology

**Assessment Objectives:**
1. **Scientific Classification**: Assign animals to appropriate Global Guardian Framework protection tiers
2. **Evidence Documentation**: Create transparent records of sentience evidence and reasoning
3. **Research Prioritization**: Identify knowledge gaps requiring urgent scientific attention
4. **Policy Support**: Provide evidence base for welfare policy development and implementation
5. **Public Understanding**: Translate complex scientific evidence into accessible public information

**Ethical Framework:**
- **Burden of Proof**: Evidence required to demonstrate absence of sentience rather than presence
- **Suffering Prevention**: Assessment errs on the side of preventing potential suffering
- **Scientific Integrity**: Maintains highest standards of scientific rigor and objectivity
- **Cultural Integration**: Incorporates traditional ecological knowledge where scientifically validated

## Section 1: Sentience Definition and Criteria

### 1.1 Operational Definition of Sentience

**Working Definition:**
Sentience is the capacity to have subjective experiences, particularly the ability to feel pleasure and pain, and to have conscious awareness of internal states and external stimuli. For the purposes of this framework, sentience encompasses:

**Core Components:**
1. **Nociception and Pain Perception**: Ability to detect harmful stimuli and experience pain as an unpleasant subjective state
2. **Conscious Awareness**: Some level of consciousness or awareness of internal states and external environment
3. **Subjective Experience**: Capacity for qualitative, first-person experiences (qualia)
4. **Emotional States**: Ability to experience positive and negative emotional states beyond basic reflexes
5. **Preference Formation**: Capacity to develop preferences and make choices based on subjective experiences

**Levels of Sentience:**
- **Basic Sentience**: Simple pain perception and basic conscious awareness
- **Complex Sentience**: Sophisticated emotional states, memory integration, anticipatory responses
- **Higher-Order Sentience**: Self-awareness, complex emotional experiences, sophisticated cognition
