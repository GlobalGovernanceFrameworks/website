# Welfare Compliance Audit Tool
## Global Guardian Framework Implementation Tool

## Purpose and Overview

This tool provides systematic protocols for auditing compliance with Global Guardian Framework welfare standards across different types of animal facilities and operations. The audit process ensures consistent evaluation, identifies improvement opportunities, and supports certification and monitoring systems.

**Audit Objectives:**
1. **Compliance Assessment**: Evaluate adherence to tier-specific welfare standards
2. **Risk Identification**: Identify potential welfare risks and violations
3. **Improvement Planning**: Provide actionable recommendations for welfare enhancement
4. **Certification Support**: Generate evidence for welfare certification decisions
5. **Monitoring Systems**: Track welfare improvements over time

**Audit Principles:**
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: All evaluations grounded in observable evidence
- **Systematic Approach**: Consistent methodology across different facilities and contexts
- **Risk-Proportionate**: Audit intensity matches potential welfare impact
- **Improvement-Oriented**: Focus on supporting welfare enhancement rather than punishment
- **Transparency**: Clear criteria and transparent reporting processes
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect for traditional practices while promoting welfare improvements

**Scope of Application:**
- Agricultural facilities (farms, ranches, aquaculture operations)
- Processing facilities (slaughterhouses, processing plants)
- Research institutions (laboratories, testing facilities)
- Entertainment venues (zoos, aquariums, circuses)
- Transportation services (livestock transport, wildlife relocation)
- Wildlife management operations (sanctuaries, rehabilitation centers)
