# Animal Welfare Carbon Credits Guide
## Global Guardian Framework Economic Tool

## Purpose and Overview

This guide provides comprehensive frameworks for developing, implementing, and trading animal welfare carbon credits that create financial incentives for welfare improvements while advancing climate goals. The system enables projects that simultaneously improve animal welfare and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to access carbon market financing, creating sustainable revenue streams for humane transitions.

**Carbon Credit Objectives:**
1. **Financial Incentives**: Create economic incentives for animal welfare improvements through carbon market revenue
2. **Climate Co-Benefits**: Advance climate mitigation goals while improving animal welfare conditions
3. **Market Innovation**: Develop new carbon market mechanisms that integrate welfare and environmental outcomes
4. **Transition Financing**: Provide revenue streams supporting transitions away from high-suffering, high-emission systems
5. **Scalable Impact**: Enable large-scale welfare improvements through market-based financing mechanisms
6. **Verification Integrity**: Ensure credible measurement and verification of both welfare and climate benefits

**Core System Principles:**
- **Additionality**: Welfare improvements that would not occur without carbon credit revenue
- **Measurable Impact**: Quantifiable improvements in both animal welfare and greenhouse gas reductions
- **Permanent Benefits**: Long-term or permanent welfare and climate improvements
- **Avoided Leakage**: Prevention of welfare problems or emissions shifting to other locations
- **Co-Benefit Integration**: Genuine integration of welfare and climate benefits rather than welfare "add-ons"
- **Community Ownership**: Local community control and benefit from carbon credit projects

**Credit Categories:**
- **Agricultural Transition Credits**: Transitions from intensive to extensive animal agriculture systems
- **Alternative Protein Credits**: Development of plant-based, fermentation, and cultivated protein systems
- **Rewilding and Restoration Credits**: Wildlife habitat restoration and ecosystem rewilding projects
- **Avoided Deforestation Credits**: Prevention of deforestation for animal agriculture expansion
- **Regenerative Agriculture Credits**: Soil carbon sequestration through animal welfare-positive grazing
- **Methane Reduction Credits**: Methane emission reductions through improved animal management
