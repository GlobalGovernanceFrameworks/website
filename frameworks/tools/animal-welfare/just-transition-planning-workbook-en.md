# Just Transition Planning Workbook
## Global Guardian Framework Economic Tool

## Purpose and Overview

This workbook provides systematic frameworks for planning and implementing just transitions that support communities, workers, and businesses affected by animal welfare policy changes. The workbook ensures that welfare improvements advance through equitable transitions that strengthen rather than harm economic security and community wellbeing.

**Transition Objectives:**
1. **Economic Security**: Maintain and enhance economic security for affected workers and communities during welfare transitions
2. **Community Resilience**: Build stronger, more diverse economies that reduce dependence on high-suffering animal industries
3. **Worker Empowerment**: Provide workers with enhanced skills, ownership opportunities, and career advancement pathways
4. **Cultural Preservation**: Respect and maintain cultural values and practices while supporting welfare improvements
5. **Environmental Integration**: Align economic transitions with environmental sustainability and climate resilience
6. **Democratic Participation**: Ensure meaningful community participation in transition planning and implementation

**Core Transition Principles:**
- **Justice and Equity**: Transition costs and benefits distributed fairly across communities and stakeholder groups
- **Community Leadership**: Local communities lead transition planning with external support rather than external imposition
- **Worker-Centered Design**: Worker needs, preferences, and expertise guide transition strategy development
- **Cultural Respect**: Traditional practices and cultural values respected and preserved through adaptation
- **Economic Diversification**: Multiple economic opportunities developed to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Transition strategies designed for lasting economic and social benefits

**Transition Scope:**
- **Individual Workers**: Career transition, skills development, and economic security support
- **Businesses and Enterprises**: Business model adaptation, market development, and operational transition
- **Communities and Regions**: Economic diversification, infrastructure development, and social cohesion
- **Supply Chains**: Value chain transformation, partnership development, and market integration
- **Policy and Regulation**: Supportive policy development, regulatory adaptation, and institutional change
