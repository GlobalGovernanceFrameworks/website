# Elder Innovation Hub Playbook

**Version 1.0 | June 2025**  
**Global Governance Framework - Aging Population Support**

## Introduction and Vision

### What is an Elder Innovation Hub?

An Elder Innovation Hub is a community-based space and program where elders lead the development of solutions to aging-related challenges and broader community problems. Unlike traditional innovation spaces that marginalize older adults, Elder Innovation Hubs position elders as primary innovators, drawing on their decades of experience, problem-solving skills, and deep understanding of community needs.

### Core Innovation Philosophy

**Elder Wisdom as Innovation Driver**: Recognizing that decades of experience create unique problem-solving capacity and deep understanding of user needs for aging-related innovations.

**Community-Centered Innovation**: Focusing on solutions that address real community challenges rather than purely commercial or technology-driven innovation.

**Intergenerational Collaboration**: Pairing elder wisdom and problem definition with younger generation technical skills and energy for maximum innovation impact.

**Inclusive Innovation Process**: Ensuring innovation benefits elder communities rather than being extracted for external profit, with elder innovators maintaining ownership and control.

### Hub Vision Statement Template

*"The [Community Name] Elder Innovation Hub will be a community space where [number] elder innovators lead the development of [specific innovation focus] solutions, creating [economic impact goals] while addressing [community challenges] through elder wisdom, intergenerational collaboration, and community-controlled innovation."*

**Example**: "The Detroit Elder Innovation Hub will be a community space where 150 elder innovators lead the development of affordable housing and community resilience solutions, creating 50 businesses and 300 jobs while addressing climate adaptation and economic development through elder wisdom, intergenerational collaboration, and community-controlled innovation."

### Expected Outcomes and Impact

**For Elder Innovators**:
- Meaningful engagement using professional expertise and life experience
- Economic opportunity through business development and patent creation

- Continued learning and skill development throughout aging

**For Communities**:

- Economic development through elder-led business creation and innovation
- Intergenerational connection and knowledge transfer
- Community problem-solving capacity building
- Models for age-friendly economic development

**For Innovation Ecosystem**:
- User-centered innovation designed by actual users of aging-related solutions
