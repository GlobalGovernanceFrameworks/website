## Section 1: Recognizing Ageism in Its Many Forms

### 1.1 Identifying Explicit and Implicit Ageism

#### Direct and Obvious Ageism

**Explicit Age Discrimination Examples**:

#### Subtle and Implicit Ageism

**Microaggressions and Subtle Discrimination**:

## Section 2: Ageism Interruption Skills and Techniques

### 2.1 Direct Interruption Strategies

#### Immediate Response Techniques

**The "Call-In" Approach** (For people you have relationship with):
- **Name the Behavior**: "That comment sounds ageist to me"
- **Explain the Impact**: "When you assume Mary can't use technology, you're limiting her participation"
- **Suggest Alternative**: "How about we ask Mary what technology support she might want?"
- **Reconnect**: "I know you care about inclusion, so I wanted to point this out"

**The "Call-Out" Approach** (For public settings or serious discrimination):
- **Direct Challenge**: "That policy discriminates against older workers"
- **Fact Correction**: "Actually, research shows older workers are highly reliable and experienced"
- **Value Statement**: "In this workplace, we value people of all ages"
- **Action Request**: "I'd like to see this policy changed to be age-inclusive"

**The "Redirect" Approach** (For subtle or unintentional ageism):
- **Positive Reframe**: "I think you mean Mary has decades of experience to contribute"
- **Question Assumptions**: "What makes you think age is relevant to this situation?"
- **Offer Information**: "Many elders are actually very comfortable with technology"
- **Focus on Individual**: "Let's focus on John's specific qualifications rather than his age"

#### Interruption Scripts and Examples

**Workplace Ageism Interruption**:

*Situation*: Colleague says, "We should get someone younger to handle the social media account."

**Interruption Options**:
- **Direct**: "That assumes older workers can't handle social media, which isn't accurate."
- **Questioning**: "What specific skills are needed for social media that would be age-related?"
- **Factual**: "Actually, older adults are the fastest-growing demographic on social media platforms."
- **Inclusive**: "Let's focus on social media experience and skills rather than age."

*Situation*: Manager suggests not including older worker in training program because "they're probably retiring soon anyway."

**Interruption Options**:
- **Policy**: "Our training policies should be based on job requirements, not age assumptions."
- **Individual**: "Have you asked Janet about her career plans, or are you assuming based on her age?"
- **Legal**: "Age-based training exclusion could be considered discrimination."
- **Value**: "We value professional development for all employees regardless of age."

**Healthcare Ageism Interruption**:

*Situation*: Healthcare provider tells elder patient, "These aches and pains are just part of getting older."

**Interruption Options** (For family member or advocate):
- **Advocacy**: "Could we explore other possible causes before attributing this to age?"
- **Information**: "Research shows many conditions are treatable regardless of age."
- **Patient Rights**: "My mother deserves the same thorough evaluation as any patient."
- **Alternative**: "What tests or treatments would you recommend for a younger patient with these symptoms?"

**Social Ageism Interruption**:

*Situation*: Someone says, "Old people are so slow and always hold up the line."

**Interruption Options**:
- **Humanizing**: "Those are individual people with their own circumstances, not just 'old people.'"
- **Perspective**: "Everyone moves at different speeds for different reasons."
- **Respect**: "Elders deserve patience and respect when they need extra time."
- **Personal**: "I hope people will be patient with me when I need extra time as I age."

### 2.2 Educational and Awareness-Building Approaches

#### Information Sharing and Myth-Busting

**Common Ageist Myths and Counter-Information**:

**Myth**: "Older workers are less productive and more expensive."
**Counter-Information**: "Research shows older workers have lower turnover, higher reliability, and fewer workplace accidents. Experience often leads to higher productivity through efficiency and problem-solving skills."

**Myth**: "Elders can't learn new technology."
**Counter-Information**: "Older adults are the fastest-growing demographic on social media and technology adoption. Learning ability doesn't decline with age when appropriate training and support are provided."

**Myth**: "Older people are set in their ways and resist change."
**Counter-Information**: "Elders have navigated more major life changes than any other age group. Resistance to change is individual, not age-related."

**Myth**: "Healthcare resources are wasted on older patients."
**Counter-Information**: "Elders contribute significantly to healthcare knowledge through research participation. Many conditions are highly treatable in older adults with excellent quality of life outcomes."

#### Educational Conversation Techniques

**The "Information Bridge" Approach**:
1. **Acknowledge the concern**: "I understand you're concerned about productivity"
2. **Provide information**: "Research actually shows that diverse age teams are more productive"
3. **Connect to values**: "Since we both value efficiency, age diversity might help us achieve that"
4. **Suggest action**: "How about we focus on individual capabilities rather than age assumptions?"

**The "Personal Story" Approach**:
1. **Share relevant experience**: "My grandmother started her own business at 70 and ran it successfully for 15 years"
2. **Connect to broader pattern**: "There are actually many elder entrepreneurs and innovators"
3. **Challenge assumption**: "Maybe age isn't the limitation we think it is"
4. **Invite reflection**: "Have you had experiences that challenge aging stereotypes?"

**The "Future Self" Approach**:
1. **Invite perspective-taking**: "Imagine yourself at 75 - what would you want people to assume about your capabilities?"
2. **Connect to current behavior**: "The attitudes we hold about aging now affect how we're treated later"
3. **Emphasize continuity**: "We're all aging - today's older adults are tomorrow's us"
4. **Encourage empathy**: "How can we create the age-inclusive world we want to age into?"

### 2.3 Bystander Intervention and Ally Behavior

#### Active Bystander Strategies

**The "Witnessing" Approach** (When direct interruption feels unsafe or inappropriate):
- **Validate the Target**: Approach the person experiencing ageism afterward to offer support
- **Document If Appropriate**: Record ageist incidents when documentation might support formal complaints

- **Follow Up**: Check in with people who experienced ageism to see how you can provide ongoing support

- **Ask Questions**: Ask questions that require the speaker to think more deeply about their assumptions
- **Introduce New Information**: Share relevant information that challenges ageist assumptions
- **Create Space**: Give the target of ageism opportunity to respond or leave the situation

**The "Delegation" Approach** (When you're not the best person to intervene):
- **Alert Authorities**: Inform supervisors, administrators, or officials who can address institutional ageism
- **Connect with Advocates**: Connect the situation with elder advocates or age discrimination experts
- **Amplify Elder Voices**: Ensure elders experiencing discrimination have platforms to speak for themselves
- **Support Collective Action**: Support elder-led organizing and advocacy addressing systemic ageism

#### Ally Development and Support

### Framework Integration

Ageism interruption is essential infrastructure for implementing the Aging Population Support Framework. By challenging ageist attitudes and creating age-inclusive environments, we build the cultural foundation necessary for:
- **AUBI recognition** of elder contributions and economic value
- **Meaningful occupation** opportunities free from age discrimination
- **Elder innovation leadership** that values accumulated wisdom and experience
- **Intergenerational communities** built on mutual respect and collaboration
- **Elder agency** in designing and leading their own support systems

**Every elder deserves to live in a world free from age discrimination, where their wisdom is valued, their contributions are recognized, and their agency is respected.**

**The future of aging is elder-led, and it begins with each of us challenging ageism wherever we encounter it.**

**Start your ageism interruption practice today. The elders in your community—and your future aging self—are counting on you.**
