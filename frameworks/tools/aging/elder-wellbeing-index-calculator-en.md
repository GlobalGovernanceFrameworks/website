## Conclusion: Elder Wellbeing Through Community Assessment and Action

### The Power of Elder-Defined Wellbeing Measurement

The Elder Wellbeing Index represents a fundamental shift from professional and institutional definitions of successful aging to elder community-controlled assessment of thriving and contribution. By measuring Purpose, Connection, Agency, and Wisdom Utilization, this assessment recognizes elders as whole human beings whose wellbeing encompasses meaningful activity, social relationships, self-determination, and community contribution.

This calculator enables elder communities to document their wellbeing, identify areas for improvement, track progress over time, and advocate for resources and programs that support elder thriving rather than simply managing decline.

### Framework Integration and Community Empowerment

The Elder Wellbeing Index integrates with all components of the Aging Population Support Framework:

**AUBI Economic Security**: Assessment of how economic security through AUBI affects all dimensions of elder wellbeing
**Meaningful Occupation**: Measurement of Purpose Score and Wisdom Utilization as outcomes of elder innovation hubs and employment inclusion
**Healthcare Integration**: Assessment of how healthcare systems affect elder Agency and overall wellbeing
**Social Inclusion**: Measurement of Connection Index as outcome of intergenerational programming and community integration
**Governance Systems**: Use of wellbeing assessment for democratic community planning and resource allocation

### Community Action and Advocacy

Elder Wellbeing Index results provide evidence for community action and advocacy:

**Community Resource Allocation**: Democratic community decisions about priorities based on assessment results and elder-identified needs
**Policy Advocacy**: Evidence for aging policy advocacy demonstrating community needs and program effectiveness
**Program Development**: Community development of programs and services addressing assessment-identified wellbeing challenges
**Elder Leadership**: Elder community leadership in wellbeing improvement and community development
