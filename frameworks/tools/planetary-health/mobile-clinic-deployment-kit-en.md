Effective planning ensures mobile clinic success.

### Steps
1. **Needs Assessment** (1-2 Months):
   - Identify target areas using health data, per *One Health Surveillance Protocols*.
   - Assess community needs (e.g., maternal care, vaccinations) via *Community Engagement Toolkit*.
   - Engage indigenous councils and youth for input, per *Youth Advisory Board Framework*.
2. **Clinic Design and Funding**:
   - Design mobile units (e.g., vans, trailers) with solar power and medical equipment for low-resource settings.
   - Secure funding via *Health Solidarity Fund Setup Guide*, *Debt-for-Health Swap Templates*, or *Health Impact Bond Framework*.
3. **Logistics Planning**:
   - Map routes prioritizing high-need areas (e.g., rural LMIC).
   - Establish supply chains for medicines and equipment, per *Open-Source Pharma Toolkit*.
   - **Staffing**:
