# Blockchain Health Records Setup Guide

**Document Purpose**: This guide provides a step-by-step roadmap for implementing a blockchain-based health records system under the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework*. The system ensures secure, transparent, and equitable access to health data, supporting Regional Health Hubs, Community Health Legions, and the Global Health Equity Council in delivering universal health coverage and crisis response. It is designed for health IT specialists, regional coordinators, community health workers, policymakers, and health advocates to deploy a privacy-focused, interoperable health records platform.

## <a id="system-architecture"></a>System Architecture

The blockchain health records system is designed for security, scalability, and accessibility.

### Core Components

- **Blockchain Ledger**:
  - **Type**: Permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) to balance security and efficiency.
  - **Data Stored**: Encrypted health record metadata (e.g., patient ID, record hash, access logs).
  - **Off-Chain Storage**: Sensitive health data stored in secure, regional databases with blockchain pointers.
- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Automate consent management, access control, and audit trails.
  - Enforce data-sharing policies (e.g., patient consent, indigenous data sovereignty).
- **Identity Management**:
  - Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for patients, providers, and hubs.
  - Biometric or token-based authentication for secure access.
- **Interoperability Layer**:
  - FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards for integration with existing systems.
  - APIs for connecting to health equity dashboards and AI tools.
- **User Interface**:
  - Patient portal (web/mobile) for consent management and data access.
  - Provider dashboard for health workers, integrated with Community Health Legion tools.
  - Multilingual, low-bandwidth options for LMIC accessibility.

### Technical Specifications

- **Consensus Mechanism**: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) for energy efficiency.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
- **Scalability**: Supports 10,000+ transactions per second per region.
- **Backup**: Redundant nodes in each WHO region, with offline storage options.

**Checklist for Architecture**:
- [ ] Select permissioned blockchain platform.
- [ ] Design off-chain storage for sensitive data.
- [ ] Implement FHIR-compliant interoperability.
- [ ] Develop multilingual user interfaces.

- **Timeline**: Years 2-3.

### Step 4: Full Operationalization (Years 4-5)
- **Objective**: Achieve global coverage and optimization.
- **Actions**:
  - Ensure universal hub integration, per *Regional Health Hub Implementation Guide*.
  - Implement advanced features (e.g., predictive analytics with AI).
  - Conduct annual security audits and community feedback surveys.
  - Resolve disputes via *Conflict Resolution Protocols*.
- **Outcome**: Global system with 1M+ records, 99.9% uptime.
- **Timeline**: Years 4-5.

## <a id="security-and-privacy-measures"></a>Security and Privacy Measures

The system prioritizes patient privacy and data security.

- **Data Encryption**:
  - Encrypt all health data (AES-256) and metadata (SHA-256 hashing).
  - Use end-to-end encryption for data sharing.
- **Consent Management**:
  - Patients control data access via smart contracts.
  - Granular consent options (e.g., share specific records with providers).
  - Revocable consent with real-time updates.
- **Access Control**:
  - Role-based access for providers, hubs, and administrators.
  - Audit trails logged on blockchain for transparency.
- **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**:
  - Indigenous communities control access to their health data.
  - Cultural agreements for traditional knowledge, per *Global Health Equity Council Setup Guide*.
- **Security Audits**:
  - Annual penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
  - Community oversight via regional health forums.
- **Disaster Recovery**:
