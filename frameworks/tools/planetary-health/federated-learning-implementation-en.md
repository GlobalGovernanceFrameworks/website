# Health Federated Learning Implementation Plan

**Document Purpose**: This guide provides a step-by-step for implementing federated learning (FL) systems under the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework* to enable secure, privacy-preserving health data analysis. The FL system supports health equity by allowing decentralized data training of AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data, benefiting Regional Health Hubs, Community Health Legions, and the Global Health Equity Council in health outcome prediction, disease surveillance, and resource optimization. It is designed for health AI developers, data scientists, regional coordinators, policymakers, policymakers, and community advocates to deploy a privacy-focused, equitable AI analytics platform.

  - **Aggregation**: Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) or differential privacy for model updates.
- **Data Sources**:
  - Health records from blockchain system, per *Blockchain Health Records Setup Guide*.
  - Health equity dashboards for aggregated metrics, per *Regional Health Hub Implementation Guide*.
  - Community Health Legion inputs for real-time data.
- **Central Server**:
  - Hosted by Global Health Equity Council or trusted third party.

- **Actions**:
  - Ensure universal hub integration.
  - Deploy advanced models (e.g., real-time outbreak detection).
  - Conduct annual privacy audits and community feedback surveys.
  - Resolve disputes via *Conflict Resolution Protocols*.
- **Outcome**: Global FL system with 500,000+ records trained, 95% accuracy.

## <span id="privacy"></span>Privacy and Compliance Measures

The FL system prioritizes patient privacy and regulatory compliance.

- **Differential Privacy**:
  - Add noise to model updates (ε ≤ 1.0) to prevent data leakage.
  - Validate privacy guarantees with external auditors.
- **Encryption**:
  - Homomorphic encryption for local model training.
  - TLS 1.3 for server-node communication.
- **Data Minimization**:
  - Use only necessary data fields for training.
  - Anonymize metadata shared with central server.
- **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**:
  - Indigenous communities control their data use in FL models.
