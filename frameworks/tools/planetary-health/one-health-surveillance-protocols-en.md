# One Health Surveillance Protocols

**Document Purpose**: These protocols provide a structured framework for implementing One Health surveillance systems under the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework*. They integrate monitoring of human, animal, and environmental health to prevent and respond to zoonotic diseases, environmental risks, and health inequities, supporting the Global Health Equity Council, Regional Health Hubs, and Community Health Legions. The protocols are designed for health workers, environmental scientists, regional coordinators, policymakers, and community leaders to ensure equitable, transparent, and effective surveillance.

- **Sustainability**: Build resilient systems with minimal ecological impact.

**Checklist for Principles**:
- [ ] Integrate multi-sectoral health data.
- [ ] Prioritize equity in surveillance coverage.

  - Fund expansion via *Health Solidarity Fund Setup Guide* or *Debt-for-Health Swap Templates*.
- **Outcome**: Surveillance systems in 6+ regions, covering 100,000+ individuals.
- **Timeline**: Years 2-3.

### Step 4: Global Integration (Years 4-5)
- **Objective**: Achieve global One Health surveillance coverage.
- **Actions**:
