## <a id="purpose-and-scope"></a>Purpose and Scope  

The AI Literacy Certifications equip stakeholders in the Planetary Health Accord with the knowledge and skills to ethically and effectively use AI-driven health systems. Designed for health workers, community leaders, traditional healers, policymakers, and technologists, these certifications ensure that AI serves health equity, respects cultural sovereignty, and aligns with One Health principles. By fostering transparency, bias auditing, and community oversight, the certifications empower users to harness AI as a tool for liberation rather than oppression, bridging modern technology with traditional wisdom.

**Objectives**:  
- Enable stakeholders to understand, deploy, and oversee AI health tools with confidence and ethical clarity.  
- Ensure AI systems are culturally competent, accessible, and free from bias through community-driven validation.  
- Promote equitable access to AI literacy, prioritizing marginalized communities and low-resource settings.  
- Support the integration of traditional healing knowledge with AI diagnostics, respecting indigenous sovereignty.
