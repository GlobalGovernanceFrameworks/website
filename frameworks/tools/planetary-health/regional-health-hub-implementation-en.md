# Regional Health Hub Implementation Guide

**Document Purpose**: This guide provides a step-by-step roadmap for establishing Regional Health Hubs, decentralized coordination bodies under the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework*. These hubs operationalize health equity initiatives, coordinate local health responses, and support the Global Health Equity Council by bridging global standards with regional needs. It is designed for regional policymakers, community leaders, health advocates, and international organizations to create inclusive, effective, and culturally responsive health systems.

## <a id="hub-structure-and-functions"></a>Hub Structure and Functions

Each Regional Health Hub is a collaborative body with a lean structure to maximize efficiency and community impact.

### Structure

- **Core Team (10-15 members)**:

  - **Technical Advisors (1-2)**: Experts in public health, epidemiology, or health technology (non-voting).
  - **Finance and Logistics Officer (1)**: Manages Global Health Solidarity Fund disbursements.
- **Term Limits**: 3-year terms, maximum two consecutive terms, except indigenous advisors (per cultural protocols).
- **Secretariat**: Small administrative team (3-5 staff) for coordination, communication, and data management.

### Functions

- **Healthcare Delivery Coordination**:
