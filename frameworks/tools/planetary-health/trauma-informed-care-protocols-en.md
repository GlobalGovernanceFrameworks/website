# Trauma-Informed Care Protocols

**Document Purpose**: These protocols provide a structured approach to implementing trauma-informed care (TIC) within the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework*, ensuring health services are sensitive to the needs of individuals affected by trauma. They guide Regional Health Hubs, Community Health Legions, and the Global Health Equity Council in delivering equitable, culturally appropriate care, particularly in crisis response and underserved communities. The protocols are designed for health workers, regional coordinators, community leaders, policymakers, and health advocates to foster safe, supportive health environments.

## <a id="trauma-informed-care-principles"></a>Trauma-Informed Care Principles

The protocols are grounded in six core TIC principles, adapted for the Accord’s global health framework:

- **Safety**: Create physical and emotional safety in healthcare settings (e.g., private consultation spaces, non-judgmental interactions).
- **Trustworthiness and Transparency**: Build trust through clear communication and consistent care, with transparent data handling (*Blockchain Health Records Setup Guide*).
- **Peer Support**: Promote community-led support networks, including youth (*Youth Advisory Board Framework*) and indigenous peers.
- **Collaboration and Mutuality**: Foster partnerships between health workers and communities, emphasizing shared decision-making.
- **Empowerment and Choice**: Prioritize patient autonomy, offering choices in treatment and data sharing (*Cybersecurity Framework for Health*).
- **Cultural, Historical, and Gender Sensitivity**: Address trauma linked to systemic inequities, respecting indigenous practices and cultural identities (*Cultural Competency Training Module*).

**Checklist for Principles**:
- [ ] Ensure safe healthcare environments.
- [ ] Maintain transparent communication.
- [ ] Establish peer support networks.
- [ ] Promote patient empowerment and cultural respect.

## <a id="implementation-steps"></a>Implementation Steps

The protocols outline a phased approach to integrate TIC into Accord health systems.

### Step 1: Assessment and Planning (1-2 Months)
- **Objective**: Identify trauma-related needs and gaps.
- **Actions**:
  - Conduct regional needs assessments with Community Health Legions, per *Community Health Legion Training Manual*.
  - Map trauma prevalence (e.g., post-disaster PTSD, gender-based violence) using health equity dashboards.
  - Engage indigenous and youth stakeholders for cultural input, per *Youth Advisory Board Framework*.
  - Develop a TIC integration plan with regional coordinators.
- **Outcome**: Regional TIC plan with priorities and timelines.
- **Timeline**: 1-2 months.

### Step 2: Pilot Implementation (6-12 Months)
- **Objective**: Test TIC in 2-3 pilot regions.
- **Actions**:
  - Select pilot regions based on trauma burden (e.g., LMIC, conflict zones).
  - Train health workers in TIC, per *Training Requirements* below.
  - Integrate TIC into primary care and crisis response, per *Mental Health Integration Toolkit*.
  - Use blockchain records for secure trauma data, audited for bias (*AI Bias Audit Framework*).
- **Outcome**: TIC active in pilot sites, serving 1,000+ patients.
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months.

### Step 3: Regional Scaling (Years 2-3)
- **Objective**: Expand TIC to all WHO regions.
- **Actions**:
  - Scale training programs across Regional Health Hubs.
  - Adapt TIC protocols to local cultural contexts, per *Cultural Competency Training Module*.
  - Deploy mobile TIC units for remote areas, integrated with telehealth.
  - Monitor outcomes via health equity dashboards.
- **Outcome**: TIC implemented in 6+ regions, 50,000+ patients served.
- **Timeline**: Years 2-3.

### Step 4: Full Integration (Years 4-5)
- **Objective**: Achieve universal TIC coverage.
- **Actions**:
  - Ensure TIC in all Accord health services, per *Regional Health Hub Implementation Guide*.
  - Use federated learning to predict trauma trends (*Federated Learning Implementation Guide*).
  - Conduct annual TIC audits and community feedback surveys.
  - Resolve disputes via *Conflict Resolution Protocols*.
- **Outcome**: Global TIC system, 500,000+ patients served annually.
- **Timeline**: Years 4-5.
