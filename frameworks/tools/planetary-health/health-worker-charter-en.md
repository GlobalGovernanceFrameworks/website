## <a id="preamble"></a>Preamble  

We, the health workers of the world, stand united in our sacred calling to heal, nurture, and transform. As Community Health Legions, traditional healers, clinicians, and public health advocates, we recognize health as a fundamental right intertwined with the well-being of communities, ecosystems, and our planet. Guided by the Planetary Health Accord, we pledge to serve as agents of liberation, weaving together traditional wisdom, modern science, and spiritual care to create equitable, resilient, and regenerative health systems. This Charter affirms our rights, responsibilities, and collective commitment to a world where every person, community, and ecosystem flourishes.

## <a id="core-principles"></a>Core Principles  

1. **Health as Sacred Service**: Health work is a spiritual and ethical calling that honors the dignity of all beings and the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health.  
2. **Equity and Justice**: Health systems must dismantle oppression, prioritize marginalized communities, and ensure universal access to care.  
3. **Cultural Competency**: Care delivery respects traditional knowledge, indigenous sovereignty, and diverse cultural practices.  
4. **Trauma-Informed Care**: Healing addresses historical, intergenerational, and systemic trauma with compassion and community collaboration.  
5. **Planetary Well-Being**: Health interventions promote ecological restoration and climate resilience, recognizing Earth as the foundation of health.  
6. **Community Empowerment**: Health workers amplify community voices, ensuring local governance and sovereignty over health systems.  
7. **Lifelong Learning**: Continuous education in traditional and modern practices empowers health workers to adapt and innovate.
