  - Scope: Hubs, communities, or fund administrators.
- **Community-Stakeholder Tensions**:
  - Example: Community Health Legions challenging hub decisions for lacking local input.
  - Scope: Communities, frontline workers, or patient advocates.
- **Cultural or Indigenous Disputes**:
  - Example: Misalignment between hub programs and indigenous health practices.
  - Scope: Indigenous councils, traditional healers, or hub coordinators.
- **Inter-Regional Conflicts**:
  - Example: Disparities in crisis response resources between WHO regions.
  - Scope: Regional Health Hubs or emergency task forces.
- **Ethical or Technical Disputes**:
  - Example: Concerns over AI health technology deployment ethics.
  - Scope: Technical advisors, council members, or external partners.

**Checklist for Conflict Identification**:
- [ ] Document the conflict’s nature and stakeholders involved.
- [ ] Assess whether indigenous or cultural issues are at play.

## <a id="resolution-process"></a>Resolution Process

The conflict resolution process follows a tiered approach to ensure efficiency and fairness.

### Step 1: Informal Dialogue (1-7 Days)
- **Objective**: Resolve disputes through direct communication.
- **Process**:
  - Stakeholders meet (in-person or virtual) with a neutral facilitator.
  - Use culturally appropriate communication methods (e.g., indigenous consensus practices).
  - Document agreements or unresolved issues.
- **Participants**: Conflicting parties, facilitator (e.g., hub coordinator or council member).
- **Outcome**: Resolution or escalation to mediation.
- **Timeline**: 1-7 days, unless urgent.

### Step 2: Mediation (8-21 Days)
- **Objective**: Facilitate structured dialogue with a trained mediator.
- **Process**:
  - Appoint a mediator from the Conflict Resolution Ombudsman roster, ensuring no conflicts of interest.
  - Conduct mediation sessions with multilingual interpretation and accessibility (e.g., sign language).
  - Solicit community or stakeholder input via digital platforms or forums.
  - Draft a mediation agreement, signed by all parties.
- **Participants**: Conflicting parties, mediator, community representatives (if applicable).
- **Outcome**: Signed agreement or escalation to arbitration.
- **Timeline**: 8-21 days.

### Step 3: Arbitration (22-60 Days)
- **Objective**: Reach a binding resolution through a formal panel.
- **Process**:
  - Convene a Multi-Stakeholder Arbitration Panel (5-7 members):
    - 1 indigenous representative (with veto power on cultural issues).
    - 1 youth representative.
    - 1 frontline health worker.
    - 1-2 regional representatives.
    - 1-2 neutral experts (e.g., public health or ethics specialists).
  - Review evidence, including stakeholder testimonies and data (e.g., fund allocation logs).
  - Issue a binding decision, published in resolution logs.
  - Allow appeals within 14 days to the Global Health Equity Council.
- **Participants**: Arbitration panel, conflicting parties, legal or cultural advisors.
- **Outcome**: Binding resolution or appeal.
- **Timeline**: 22-60 days.

## <a id="escalation-mechanisms"></a>Escalation Mechanisms

For unresolved or complex conflicts, escalation ensures impartial resolution.

- **Global Health Equity Council Review**:
  - Appeals from arbitration go to the Council’s Conflict Resolution Committee.
  - Committee includes 3-5 members (indigenous, youth, regional representatives).
  - Decision within 30 days, with public reporting.
- **Neutral Arbitration Court**:
  - For disputes involving the Council itself, escalate to an independent court.
  - Court comprises international health law experts and community advocates.
  - Decisions are final, published within 48 hours.
- **Community Oversight**:
  - Annual Global Biodiversity Forum reviews conflict trends.
  - Digital platforms collect community feedback on resolutions.
- **Emergency Protocols**:
  - For urgent conflicts (e.g., crisis response delays), activate Fast-Track Resolution:
    - 24-hour informal dialogue.
    - 72-hour mediation or arbitration.
    - Prioritize indigenous and community voices.

**Checklist for Escalation**:
- [ ] Verify appeal eligibility (e.g., within 14 days).
- [ ] Ensure indigenous representation in review panels.
- [ ] Publish resolution outcomes in UN official languages.
- [ ] Collect community feedback post-resolution.

## <a id="cultural-competency-and-equity-considerations"></a>Cultural Competency and Equity Considerations

Conflict resolution prioritizes cultural safety, indigenous sovereignty, and equity.

- **Indigenous Sovereignty**:

- **Language Justice**:
  - Provide mediation and arbitration in local and UN official languages.
  - Offer sign language and braille for accessibility.
  - Train facilitators in multilingual communication.
- **Gender and Disability Inclusion**:
  - Ensure gender balance in mediation and arbitration panels.
  - Design accessible processes (e.g., virtual platforms, audio formats).
- **Community-Centered Approach**:
  - Prioritize marginalized voices (e.g., LMIC communities, refugees).
  - Use traditional communication methods (e.g., oral storytelling) for engagement.
- **Transparency**:
  - Publish resolution logs in accessible formats (e.g., infographics).
  - Allow public comment periods on arbitration outcomes.

**Checklist for Equity**:
- [ ] Include indigenous veto power in cultural disputes.
- [ ] Translate materials into 3+ languages.
- [ ] Verify accessibility for people with disabilities.
- [ ] Engage marginalized communities in resolution processes.
