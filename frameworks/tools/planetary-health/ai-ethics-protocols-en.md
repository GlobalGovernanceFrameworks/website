## <a id="purpose-and-scope"></a>Purpose and Scope  

The **AI Ethics Protocols** provide a comprehensive framework to ensure the ethical development, deployment, and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) within the Planetary Health Accordâ€™s health systems. These protocols aim to safeguard communities, respect cultural sovereignty, and promote planetary well-being by embedding justice, transparency, and accountability in AI applications. They address risks such as algorithmic bias, data exploitation, and cultural insensitivity, while fostering trust through community oversight and integration with traditional healing practices. The protocols apply to all stakeholders, including health workers, technologists, policymakers, and Community Health Legions, across global and local health contexts.

**Objectives**:  
- Ensure AI systems prioritize health equity and community empowerment.  
- Protect cultural and indigenous knowledge from appropriation or misuse in AI development.  
- Mitigate algorithmic bias and ensure transparency in AI decision-making.  
- Align AI applications with One Health principles, supporting human, animal, and environmental health.  
- Establish community-driven governance and accountability mechanisms for AI systems.  

## <a id="core-ethical-principles"></a>Core Ethical Principles  

The protocols are grounded in the following ethical principles, aligned with the Planetary Health Accord:  

1. **Justice and Equity**: AI systems must prioritize marginalized communities, ensuring equitable access to benefits and protection from harm.  
2. **Community Sovereignty**: Communities have authority over AI systems, including data ownership and decision-making processes (see [Governance Structure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#01-governance-structure)).  
3. **Cultural Respect**: AI respects traditional healing practices, indigenous cosmologies, and local cultural norms, avoiding appropriation or erasure.  
4. **Transparency**: AI processes, including algorithms and data sources, are open and understandable to communities and stakeholders.  
5. **Accountability**: Developers and users of AI are accountable for outcomes, with mechanisms for redress and system correction.  
6. **One Health Alignment**: AI supports interconnected human, animal, and environmental health, contributing to planetary resilience (see [Pandemic and Climate-Preparedness](/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#05-pandemic-climate-preparedness)).  
7. **Do No Harm**: AI systems are designed to prevent harm, with safeguards like kill switches and bias audits to mitigate risks.  

## <a id="ai-ethics-protocols"></a>AI Ethics Protocols  

The following protocols outline specific requirements for ethical AI use in health systems:  

1. **Community Consent and Control**  
   - Obtain free, prior, and informed consent from communities before deploying AI systems.  
   - Establish Community AI Oversight Boards within health assemblies to govern AI use.  
   - Ensure communities can veto or modify AI applications that conflict with cultural or ethical values.  

2. **Data Sovereignty and Privacy**  
   - Store health data under community-controlled, federated learning networks to protect privacy (see [Technology and Data Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#02-technology-data-infrastructure)).  
   - Prohibit commercialization or unauthorized sharing of health data, with quantum-resistant encryption for security.  
   - Respect indigenous data sovereignty, ensuring traditional knowledge is used only with explicit community agreements.  

3. **Bias Mitigation and Fairness**  
   - Conduct quarterly bias audits with community input, using the [AI Bias Audit Framework](/frameworks/tools/planetary-health/ai-bias-audit-framework-en.pdf).  
   - Train AI models on diverse, representative datasets, including data from marginalized populations.  
   - Provide visual explanation interfaces and confidence scores to make AI decisions interpretable.  

4. **Cultural Competency**  
   - Adapt AI interfaces to local languages, cultural health concepts, and traditional practices, co-designed with traditional healers.  
   - Prohibit AI systems that undermine or replace indigenous healing without community consent.  
   - Include cultural competency modules in AI development, aligned with [Cultural Competency Guidelines](/frameworks/tools/planetary-health/cultural-competency-guidelines-en.pdf).  

5. **Transparency and Explainability**  
   - Publish open-source AI algorithms and data sources, excluding sensitive cultural data, via the [Global Knowledge Commons](/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#13-global-knowledge-commons).  
   - Provide plain-language explanations of AI processes to communities, available in multiple formats (e.g., audio, text).  
   - Disclose all AI failures or errors transparently, with immediate corrective actions.  

6. **Harm Prevention Mechanisms**  
   - Implement kill switch protocols to halt AI systems causing harm, accessible to Community AI Oversight Boards.  
   - Establish AI Red Teams to proactively identify risks, including bias, security, and cultural insensitivity.  
   - Ban AI systems that automate decisions without human oversight in critical health contexts (e.g., diagnostics, triage).  

7. **Planetary Health Integration**  
   - Use AI to monitor One Health connections, such as zoonotic disease risks and environmental health trends.  
   - Align AI applications with climate-adaptive care, supporting ecosystem restoration and resilience.  
   - Ensure AI systems minimize environmental impact, using energy-efficient algorithms and hardware.  

## <a id="implementation-guidelines"></a>Implementation Guidelines  

To operationalize the protocols, stakeholders should follow these steps:  

1. **Establish Governance Structures** (Months 1-3)  
   - Form Community AI Oversight Boards within health assemblies, including traditional healers and marginalized group representatives.  
   - Train boards using [AI Literacy Certifications](/frameworks/tools/planetary-health/ai-literacy-certifications-en.pdf) to ensure ethical oversight capacity.  

2. **Conduct Ethical Assessments** (Months 4-6)  
   - Assess proposed AI systems against the protocols using the [Policy Integration Toolkit](/frameworks/tools/planetary-health/policy-integration-toolkit-en.pdf).  
   - Engage communities to validate AI alignment with cultural and equity goals.  

3. **Develop and Deploy AI Systems** (Months 7-12)  
   - Co-design AI tools with communities, ensuring open-source development and cultural adaptation.  
   - Pilot AI systems in Health Sanctuary nations, with continuous community feedback.  

4. **Monitor and Report** (Ongoing)
