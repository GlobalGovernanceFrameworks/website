# Cybersecurity Framework for Health

**Document Purpose**: This framework provides a structured approach to securing health systems, data, and technologies under the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework*. It ensures the protection of sensitive health information, such as blockchain-based health records and federated learning models, across Regional Health Hubs, Community Health Legions, and the Global Health Equity Council. The framework is designed for health IT specialists, regional coordinators, community health workers, policymakers, and health advocates to maintain data integrity, privacy, and trust in equitable health systems.

## <a id="cybersecurity-principles"></a>Cybersecurity Principles

The framework is guided by core principles to ensure robust and equitable security.

- **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive health data (e.g., patient records, indigenous health information) from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity**: Ensure health data and systems remain accurate and tamper-proof.
- **Availability**: Guarantee uninterrupted access to health systems for authorized users, especially during crises.
- **Equity**: Prioritize security solutions accessible to LMIC and marginalized communities.
- **Transparency**: Maintain open reporting of security incidents and audits.
- **Sovereignty**: Respect indigenous control over their health data and cultural protocols.
- **Resilience**: Enable rapid recovery from cyber incidents with minimal disruption.

**Checklist for Principles**:
- [ ] Define confidentiality measures for health data.
- [ ] Ensure data integrity with tamper-proof systems.
- [ ] Verify system availability in low-resource settings.
- [ ] Incorporate indigenous sovereignty protocols.

## <a id="risk-assessment-process"></a>Risk Assessment Process

Regular risk assessments identify and prioritize cyber threats to health systems.

### Step 1: Asset Identification (1-2 Weeks)
- **Objective**: Catalog critical health systems and data.
- **Actions**:
  - List assets: blockchain records, federated learning nodes, health equity dashboards, per *Blockchain Health Records Setup Guide* and *Federated Learning Implementation Guide*.
  - Identify sensitive data: patient records, indigenous health data, AI model outputs.
  - Map data flows across Regional Health Hubs and Community Health Legions.
- **Outcome**: Asset inventory with sensitivity levels.
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks.

### Step 2: Threat Identification (2-3 Weeks)
- **Objective**: Assess potential cyber threats.
- **Actions**:
  - Identify threats: ransomware, phishing, insider attacks, data breaches.
  - Evaluate vulnerabilities: outdated software, weak authentication, low digital literacy.
  - Consider regional risks (e.g., unstable internet in LMICs, cultural data misuse).
- **Outcome**: Threat and vulnerability report.
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks.

### Step 3: Risk Analysis (1-2 Weeks)
- **Objective**: Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood.
- **Actions**:
  - Assess impact: patient harm, health equity disruption, trust loss.
  - Evaluate likelihood: based on regional infrastructure and threat trends.
  - Use risk matrix (e.g., High/Medium/Low) to prioritize.
  - Consult indigenous and youth stakeholders for equity impacts, per *Youth Advisory Board Framework*.
- **Outcome**: Prioritized risk register.
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks.

### Step 4: Risk Monitoring (Ongoing)
- **Objective**: Continuously track risks.
- **Actions**:
  - Deploy real-time monitoring tools (e.g., intrusion detection systems).
  - Conduct quarterly risk reviews with Regional Health Hubs.
  - Update risk register based on new threats or incidents.
- **Outcome**: Dynamic risk management plan.
- **Timeline**: Ongoing.

## <a id="mitigation-strategies"></a>Mitigation Strategies

The framework outlines strategies to prevent, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.

### Prevention
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit, per *Blockchain Health Records Setup Guide*.
- **Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) with biometric or token options.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access for providers, hubs, and patients, logged on blockchain.
- **Training**: Conduct cybersecurity awareness programs for health workers and communities, emphasizing phishing and social engineering.
- **Patching**: Apply software updates within 7 days of release.

### Detection
- **Monitoring**: Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use AI-based anomaly detection, audited per *AI Bias Audit Framework*.
- **Audits**: Conduct annual penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
- **Audits**: Conduct annual audits of anomaly detection systems, penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
- **Incident Reporting**: Establish anonymous reporting channels for staff and communities.

### Response
- **Incident Response Plan**:
  - Activate response team within 24 hours of detection.
  - Contain threat (e.g., isolate affected systems).
  - Notify stakeholders stakeholders, including including communities, within 48 hours.
- **Forensics**: Log incidents on blockchain for auditability.
- **Communication**: Use multilingual alerts via community channels, per *Community Engagement Toolkit*.

### Recovery
- **Data Restoration**: Use redundant backups with offline storage.
- **System Rebuild**: Restore systems from secure enclaves within 72 hours.
- **Lessons Learned**: Conduct post-incident review within 7 days, per *Conflict Resolution Protocols*.
- **Checklist for Mitigation**:
  - [ ] Deploy encryption and MFA.
  - [ ] Install IDS/SIEM tools.
  - [ ] Train 100% staff on cybersecurity.
  - [ ] Test incident response plan annually.
