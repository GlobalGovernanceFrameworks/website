# Cost-Benefit Analysis Model

**Purpose**: Quantifies the economic and social returns of adopting the *Regenerative Educational Systems Implementation Framework*, providing evidence to justify funding and advocacy efforts, as outlined in resource mobilization strategies ([Section 4.7](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) and cost-benefit analysis details ([Section 10.3](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#10-appendices)). This model supports stakeholder decision-making, aligning with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

**Usage**:
- **Who**: Local champions, policymakers, funders, and NGOs seeking to secure resources or evaluate framework impact.
- **How**: Use the model to estimate costs, project financial and social benefits, and create advocacy materials (e.g., infographics) tailored to local contexts.
- **When**: During pilot planning ([Section 4.4.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)), scaling ([Section 4.4.2](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)), or funding negotiations ([Section 4.7](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
- **Formats**: Editable Excel spreadsheet, PDF summary, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille, simplified text).

**Equity Safeguards**:
- Prioritizes benefits for marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees) in calculations and advocacy.
- Multilingual and low-tech formats (e.g., printable summaries, oral explanations) ensure accessibility in low-connectivity or low-literacy regions.
- Community-led validation ensures cost and benefit estimates reflect local priorities and cultural contexts ([Section 5.5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
- Transparent methodology shared with communities to build trust and inclusion.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Model

### Section 1: Overview and Methodology
**Purpose**: Provides a transparent framework for calculating costs and benefits, grounded in framework outcomes ([Section 5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
**Methodology**:
- **Costs**: Direct (e.g., training, materials, tech) and indirect (e.g., staff time, infrastructure) expenses, estimated per tier ([Section 4.2](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
- **Benefits**: Financial (e.g., economic returns from improved literacy, job creation) and social (e.g., equity, climate resilience, civic engagement), quantified using case model data ([Section 8](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#08-case-models)).
- **Time Horizon**: 5–10 years, with short-term (1–2 years) and long-term (5–10 years) projections.
- **Data Sources**: Pilot outcomes (e.g., 80% systems thinking proficiency, [Section 8.3](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#08-case-models)), global education studies (e.g., UNESCO 2024, [Section 10.7](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#10-appendices)), and community feedback ([Section 5.6](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
- **Equity Focus**: Disaggregates benefits by marginalized groups to highlight inclusive impact (e.g., 90% equity index, [Section 5.3](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).

**Instructions**:
- Input local data (e.g., pilot scale, regional wages) into the model.
- Validate assumptions with community boards, ensuring 50% marginalized representation ([Section 5.5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
- Use results in policy briefs and advocacy materials ([Section 10.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#10-appendices)).

### Section 2: Cost Inputs
**Purpose**: Estimates the financial investment required for framework adoption, tailored to implementation tiers ([Section 4.2](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).

### Section 4: Analysis and Interpretation
**Purpose**: Calculates net benefits and return on investment (ROI) to support advocacy ([Section 4.11](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
**Formulas**:
- **Net Benefit** = Total Benefits – Total Costs
  - Tier 1: $1M – $50K = $950K
  - Tier 2: $10M – $500K = $9.5M
  - Tier 3: $2B – $5M = $1.995B
- **ROI** = (Net Benefit / Cost) × 100
  - Tier 1: ($950K / $50K) × 100 = 1,900%
  - Tier 2: ($9.5M / $500K) × 100 = 1,900%
  - Tier 3: ($1.995B / $5M) × 100 = 39,900%

**Instructions**:
- Input cost and benefit data into Excel model to calculate ROI.
- Validate results with community boards, ensuring marginalized group input ([Section 5.5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
- Summarize findings in policy briefs or presentations ([Section 10.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#10-appendices)).

**Customization**:
- Adjust time horizon or discount rate for local economic conditions.
- Emphasize social benefits (e.g., equity, civic engagement) in equity-focused regions.

### Section 5: Advocacy Infographic
**Purpose**: Visualizes key costs and benefits for stakeholder engagement ([Section 7.2](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#07-visual-multimedia)).
**Template**:
- **Title**: Investing in Regenerative Education
- **Visuals**:
  - Bar chart: Costs ($50K–$5M) vs. Benefits ($1M–$2B) by tier.
  - Pie chart: Benefit breakdown (economic, educational, social, environmental).
  - Icons: Youth councils, restored ecosystems, equitable hubs.
- **Key Stats**:
  - ROI: 1,900%–39,900% over 5–10 years.
  - Equity: 90%–98% diversity compliance.
  - Impact: 10–1,000 hectares restored, 80% systems thinking proficiency.
- **Call to Action**: Fund a pilot to transform education and ecosystems.

**Instructions**:
- Customize with local stats and cultural visuals (e.g., Indigenous art).
- Produce in high-contrast, text-alternative formats for accessibility.

**Customization**:
- Add local examples (e.g., coral restoration in Pacific Islands).
- Translate into regional languages and dialects.

## Instructions for Use
1. **Gather Data**: Collect local cost data (e.g., wages, materials) and benefit projections from pilot outcomes or case models ([Section 8](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#08-case-models)).
2. **Customize Model**: Input data into the Excel spreadsheet, adjusting for regional priorities and equity needs ([Section 5.5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
3. **Validate**: Engage community boards with 50% marginalized representation to confirm assumptions and outcomes.
4. **Analyze**: Calculate net benefits and ROI, using results to inform funding pitches ([Section 4.7](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
5. **Create Advocacy Materials**: Summarize findings in policy briefs, presentations, or infographics ([Section 10.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#10-appendices)).
6. **Share and Iterate**: Distribute via global dashboard ([Section 5.8](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)), refine based on stakeholder feedback ([Section 5.7](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).

## Example Use
In Brazil, this model justified $5M for youth parliaments, projecting $20M in social returns over 7 years, including 90% equity compliance and 200 hectares restored. The infographic and ROI of 1,900% secured ministry and NGO funding, impacting 2,000 learners ([Section 8.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#08-case-models)).
