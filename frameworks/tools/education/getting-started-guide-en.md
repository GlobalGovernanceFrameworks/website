# Getting Started Guide: Start with the Seed Kit

**Purpose**: Introduces the “Start with the Seed” kit, a collection of tools and modules to launch Tier 1 micro-pilots of the *Regenerative Educational Systems Implementation Framework*, guiding communities to integrate regenerative education ([Section 4.3](#]). This guide explains how to use the kit’s components together and provides a suggested implementation timeline, fostering equity and alignment with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

**Usage**:
- **Who**: Local champions, educators, youth councils, and community leaders initiating micro-pilots (10–100 learners) ([Section 4.2](#]).
- **How**: Follow the guide to assess readiness, train facilitators, deliver modules, and monitor progress, adapting to local contexts.
- **When**: During pilot planning and launch phases ([Section 4.4.1](#]), as the entry point for the Seed Kit ([Section 4.3](#]).
- **Formats**: Editable Word document, PDF, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille, simplified text).

**Equity Safeguards**:
- Ensures 50% participation from marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees) in planning and implementation.
- Multilingual and low-tech materials (e.g., oral guides, printable timelines) support accessibility in low-connectivity or low-literacy regions.
- Community-led validation ensures components and timelines reflect local priorities and cultural contexts ([Section 5.5](#]).
- Anonymous feedback channels protect participants in sensitive contexts (e.g., authoritarian or conflict-affected regions).

## Getting Started Guide

### Overview
**Purpose**: Provides a roadmap to launch a micro-pilot using the Seed Kit, integrating its components to foster systems thinking, equity, and regenerative impact.  
**Components**:
- **Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool** ([Section 10.4](#]): Evaluates community readiness for pilots ([Download](./pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool.md)).
- **Spiral Dynamics Introduction for Educators** ([Section 3.2](#]): Introduces developmental stages for teaching ([Download](./spiral-dynamics-intro-educators.md)).
- **Equity Training and Inclusion Checklist** ([Section 2.2.5](#]): Ensures inclusive practices and equity audits ([Download](./equity-training-inclusion-checklist.md)).
- **Systems Thinking Module** ([Section 4.3](#]): Teaches learners to map and intervene in systems ([Download](./systems-thinking-module.md)).
**Duration**: 3–6 months from planning to pilot completion, with flexible pacing for local needs.  
**Outcomes** ([Section 5.2](#]):
- Achieve 80% systems thinking proficiency among learners.
- Ensure 90% equity compliance in pilot activities.
- Launch 1+ regenerative projects with 50% marginalized leadership.

### Section 1: Understanding the Seed Kit
**Purpose**: Explains how Seed Kit components work together to launch a micro-pilot ([Section 4.3](#]).  
**Integration**:
- **Readiness Assessment**: Use the Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool to evaluate political will, funding, and stakeholder buy-in, ensuring 50% marginalized representation in the process ([Section 10.4](#]).
- **Educator Preparation**: Train facilitators with the Spiral Dynamics Introduction and Equity Training modules to align teaching with developmental stages and equity principles ([Section 3.2](#], [Section 2.2.5](#]).
- **Curriculum Delivery**: Implement the Systems Thinking Module to teach learners core skills, adapting activities to local ecosystems and cultures ([Section 4.3](#]).
- **Equity Monitoring**: Apply the Inclusion Checklist to audit and enhance equity in all activities, from lesson plans to community engagement ([Section 2.2.5](#]).
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Use the M&E Rubric Template ([Section 10.1](#]) to track outcomes, integrating feedback via real-time loops ([Section 5.7](#]).

**Activity**:  
- **Component Mapping (30 min)**:  
  - Form a planning team (50% marginalized representation) to review Seed Kit components.  
  - Discuss: “How will each component address our community’s needs?”  
  - Create a visual or oral map linking components to local priorities (e.g., climate resilience, cultural preservation).  
  - Equity: Tactile maps for visually impaired, multilingual discussions.

**Customization**: Tailor component use to local challenges (e.g., water access in Sahel, urban equity in Brazil).

   - Collect qualitative feedback (e.g., learner stories) via surveys or oral reports.  
   - Equity: Anonymous feedback, 50% marginalized input in evaluation.  
5. **Share and Iterate**:  
   - Document successes via multimedia ([Section 7.2](#]), share via global forums ([Section 5.10](#]).  
   - Refine pilot based on feedback, plan scaling with cost-benefit analysis ([Section 10.3](#]).  
   - Equity: Amplify marginalized voices in stories.

**Activity**:

  - Planning team reviews timeline and assigns roles for each phase.  
  - Create a visual or oral timeline, mapping components to community goals.  
  - Discuss: “What local strengths can we leverage? What barriers must we address?”  
  - Equity: Tactile timelines for visually impaired, multilingual discussions.

**Customization**: Adjust steps for local governance (e.g., tribal councils in Indigenous areas, municipal boards in urban hubs).

### Section 4: Tips for Success
**Purpose**: Provides practical advice to ensure effective Seed Kit implementation ([Section 4.4](#]).  
**Tips**:
- **Community Engagement**: Host forums with 50% marginalized participation to build buy-in ([Section 4.12](#]).

## Example Use (fictive)
In Sudan, a community used the Seed Kit to launch a pilot for 100 learners, achieving 85% systems thinking proficiency and 95% equity compliance. The Getting Started Guide’s timeline guided a 4-month implementation, with the Equity Checklist ensuring 40% refugee leadership in a regenerative water project, increasing access by 30% ([Section 4.3](#]).
