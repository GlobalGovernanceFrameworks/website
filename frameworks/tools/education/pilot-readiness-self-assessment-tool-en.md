# Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool

**Purpose**: Evaluates a community’s readiness to launch pilots of the *Regenerative Educational Systems Implementation Framework*, identifying strengths, gaps, and actionable steps to ensure successful implementation, as outlined in phased implementation strategies ([Section 4.4](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) and pilot readiness details ([Section 10.4](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#10-appendices)). This tool fosters preparedness and equity, aligning with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

**Usage**:
- **Who**: Local champions, educators, youth councils, and community leaders planning Tier 1 micro-pilots ([Section 4.2](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
- **How**: Complete the assessment to score readiness across key criteria, review recommendations, and develop a preparation plan.
- **When**: Before launching pilots, during the “Start with the Seed” kit phase ([Section 4.3](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)), or as part of resilience planning ([Section 4.6](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
- **Formats**: Editable Word document, PDF, online survey, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille, oral formats).

**Equity Safeguards**:
- Ensures 50% representation of marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees) in assessment teams.
- Multilingual and low-tech formats (e.g., printable checklists, oral instructions) support accessibility in low-connectivity or low-literacy regions.
- Community-led validation ensures criteria and recommendations reflect local priorities and cultural contexts ([Section 5.5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
- Anonymous scoring options protect participants in sensitive contexts (e.g., authoritarian or conflict-affected regions).

## Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool

### Section 1: Assessment Criteria
**Purpose**: Evaluates readiness across five key criteria critical for pilot success, grounded in implementation strategies ([Section 4.4](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
**Instructions**:
- Score each criterion on a 0–5 scale (0 = Not Present, 5 = Fully Developed).
- Collect input from diverse stakeholders, ensuring 50% marginalized representation.
- Calculate total score (out of 25) to determine readiness level and review recommendations.

**Criteria and Rubric**:

| **Criterion** | **Description** | **0 (Not Present)** | **3 (Moderately Developed)** | **5 (Fully Developed)** | **Equity Notes** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Political Will | Support from local leaders, ministries, or unions ([Section 4.11](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) | No support identified | Informal support from 1–2 leaders | Formal commitment from ministry or council | Include Indigenous, refugee voices in advocacy |
| Funding Availability | Access to grants, budgets, or philanthropy ([Section 4.7](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) | No funding secured | $10K–$20K identified | $50K+ committed for pilot | Subsidies for low-income regions |
| Stakeholder Buy-In | Engagement from educators, families, youth ([Section 4.12](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) | No engagement | 50% of stakeholders supportive | 80%+ actively engaged | Prioritize LGBTQ+, caste-oppressed input |
| Legal Flexibility | Ability to adapt curricula or governance ([Section 4.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)) | No flexibility | Partial flexibility (e.g., electives) | Full approval for pilot curriculum | Community validation for cultural fit |
