# Financial Pathway Assessment Tool

**Purpose**: Helps communities, educators, and stakeholders evaluate their readiness for Track 1 (Pragmatic Transition) versus Track 2 (Non-Extractive Transformation) implementation of the *Regenerative Educational Systems Implementation Framework*'s dual-track financial model ([Section 4.15](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#415-financial-framework-architecture)). This tool ensures alignment between community values, capacity, and financial strategy, supporting SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

**Usage**:
- **Who**: Community leaders, educators, youth councils, and local organizations planning framework implementation.
- **How**: Complete the assessment across five dimensions, calculate pathway scores, and review recommendations for optimal financial strategy selection.
- **When**: During initial pilot planning ([Section 4.4.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)), before securing funding, or when transitioning between tracks.
- **Formats**: Editable Word document, PDF, online survey, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille, oral formats).

**Equity Safeguards**:
- Ensures 50% representation of marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees) in assessment teams.
- Multilingual and low-tech formats (e.g., printable worksheets, oral facilitation) support accessibility in low-connectivity regions.
- Community-led validation ensures assessment criteria reflect local values and cultural contexts ([Section 5.5](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#05-monitoring-evaluation)).
- Anonymous scoring options protect participants in sensitive political contexts.
