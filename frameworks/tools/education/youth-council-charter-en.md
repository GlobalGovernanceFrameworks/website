# Youth Council Charter Template

**Purpose**: Provides a customizable governance framework for establishing youth councils, empowering learners to participate in decision-making and policy development, as outlined in the framework’s structural components ([Section 3.4](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#03-structural-components)). This template fosters global citizenship, equity, and inclusive leadership, aligning with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions).

**Usage**:
- **Who**: Youth (ages 10–18), educators, community leaders, and policymakers launching local or regional youth parliaments.
- **How**: Adapt the template to define council mission, roles, processes, and equity mandates, then ratify through community consensus.
- **When**: During pilot planning ([Section 4.4.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)), scaling ([Section 4.4.2](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)), or as part of the “Start with the Seed” kit ([Section 4.3](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#04-implementation-strategies)).
- **Formats**: Editable Word document, PDF, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille, sign language).

**Equity Safeguards**:
- Ensures at least 30% representation of marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees) in membership and leadership.
- Multilingual materials and oral formats support linguistic and accessibility needs.
- Anonymous voting and feedback options protect vulnerable participants in sensitive contexts (e.g., authoritarian regions).
- Free distribution prioritizes low-income and crisis-affected communities.

## Example Use
In 2024, Nordic youth councils adapted this charter to govern 2,000 learners across 10 municipalities, achieving 40% marginalized representation and influencing climate policies that reduced emissions by 10% ([Section 8.1](/frameworks/docs/implementation/education#08-case-models)). The charter’s equity mandates ensured LGBTQ+ and neurodiverse voices shaped solar park proposals, earning 90% member satisfaction.
