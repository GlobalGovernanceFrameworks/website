# Systems Thinking Module

**Purpose**: Introduces learners (ages 10–18) to systems thinking, a core competency of the *Regenerative Educational Systems Implementation Framework*, enabling them to map, analyze, and intervene in complex systems (e.g., ecosystems, communities, economies) as outlined in the spiral dynamics curriculum ([Section 3.2](#]). This module fosters critical thinking and regenerative problem-solving, aligning with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

**Usage**:
- **Who**: Educators, youth facilitators, and community leaders delivering the “Start with the Seed” kit in Tier 1 micro-pilots ([Section 4.3](#]).
- **How**: Implement the module over 4–6 weeks (8–12 hours) through hands-on activities, discussions, and projects, adaptable to local contexts.
- **When**: As part of pilot curriculum integration ([Section 4.4.1](#]) or standalone workshops in the Seed Kit ([Section 4.3](#]).
- **Formats**: Editable Word document, PDF, and markdown, available in 10+ languages, with accessible versions (e.g., audio, braille, visual aids).

**Equity Safeguards**:
- Ensures 50% participation from marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees) in activities and leadership roles.
- Multilingual and low-tech materials (e.g., oral storytelling, tactile diagrams) support accessibility in low-connectivity or low-literacy regions.
- Community-led adaptation ensures activities reflect local ecosystems and cultural priorities ([Section 5.5](#]).
- Safe, inclusive spaces with anonymous feedback protect vulnerable learners in sensitive contexts.

## Systems Thinking Module

### Overview
**Duration**: 4–6 weeks (8–12 hours total, 2–3 hours per week).  
**Learning Outcomes** ([Section 5.2](#]):
- Identify elements, connections, and feedback loops in a system (80% proficiency target).
- Analyze system behavior and propose regenerative interventions (70% proficiency target).
- Collaborate inclusively, demonstrating empathy and cultural awareness (75% improvement target).
**Structure**: Four units, each with activities, reflections, and assessments, designed for spiral dynamics stages (e.g., tribal, modern, integral, [Section 3.2](#]).

### Unit 1: Understanding Systems
**Purpose**: Introduce systems thinking concepts (elements, connections, feedback loops) through local contexts ([Section 3.2](#]).  
**Duration**: 2–3 hours.  
**Activities**:
1. **Story Circle (45 min)**:
   - Learners share stories about their community or ecosystem (e.g., a river, market, school).
   - Prompt: “What parts make up this place? How do they connect?”
   - Facilitator draws a simple system map (e.g., river → fish → farmers → market) on a board or sand.
   - Equity: Oral storytelling for non-literate learners, multilingual prompts.
2. **System Hunt (45 min)**:
   - In small groups (50% marginalized representation), learners explore a local system (e.g., garden, village) and list 5–10 elements (e.g., plants, water, insects).
   - Create a poster or tactile model showing connections (e.g., water feeds plants).
   - Equity: Tactile models for visually impaired, sensory-friendly spaces.
3. **Reflection (30 min)**:
   - Discuss: “What surprised you about how things connect? How do people shape this system?”
   - Record responses in journals, audio, or drawings for accessibility.

**Materials**: Paper, markers, sand/clay for models, audio recorders.  
**Assessment**: System map with 5+ elements and 3+ connections (scored via M&E rubric, [Section 10.1](#]).  
**Customization**: Use local systems (e.g., coral reefs in Pacific Islands, urban transport in cities).

### Unit 2: Mapping Feedback Loops
**Purpose**: Explore system dynamics (reinforcing and balancing feedback loops) using real-world examples ([Section 3.2](#]).  
**Duration**: 2–3 hours.  
**Activities**:
1. **Feedback Loop Game (60 min)**:
   - Simulate a system (e.g., population growth: more people → more food needed → more farming → more people).
   - Learners act as elements (e.g., farmers, crops), adjusting roles to show reinforcing loops.
   - Introduce a balancing loop (e.g., water scarcity limits farming).
   - Equity: Physical or verbal roles for accessibility, multilingual instructions.
2. **Local Loop Mapping (45 min)**:
   - Groups map a local system’s feedback loops (e.g., deforestation: more logging → less trees → more erosion → less soil → less trees).
   - Use diagrams, string, or oral descriptions to show loops.
   - Equity: String models for tactile learners, oral mapping for non-literate.
3. **Reflection (30 min)**:
   - Discuss: “What happens when a system grows too fast? How can balance help?”
   - Record in accessible formats (e.g., voice notes, visual journals).

**Materials**: String, paper, markers, audio recorders.  
**Assessment**: Feedback loop diagram with 1 reinforcing and 1 balancing loop (scored via M&E rubric, [Section 10.1](#]).  
**Customization**: Focus on local issues (e.g., water cycles in Sahel, urban waste in cities).

### Unit 3: Analyzing System Behavior
**Purpose**: Analyze system patterns and unintended consequences, fostering critical thinking ([Section 5.2](#]).  
**Duration**: 2–3 hours.  
**Activities**:
1. **Case Study Discussion (45 min)**:
   - Present a local case (e.g., overfishing: more fishing → fewer fish → less income → more fishing).
   - Learners identify patterns (e.g., collapse) and consequences (e.g., hunger).
   - Equity: Multilingual case summaries, oral discussions for accessibility.
2. **What-If Scenarios (60 min)**:
   - Groups propose changes to the system (e.g., fishing quotas, alternative jobs).
   - Predict outcomes using “if-then” statements (e.g., “If we limit fishing, then fish populations may recover”).
   - Create a visual or oral presentation of scenarios.
   - Equity: Visual aids for neurodiverse learners, anonymous input for shy participants.
3. **Reflection (30 min)**:
   - Discuss: “What unintended effects might our solutions create? How can we plan for them?”
   - Record in journals, audio, or drawings.

**Materials**: Case study handouts, paper, markers, audio recorders.  
**Assessment**: Scenario presentation with 2+ outcomes predicted (scored via M&E rubric, [Section 10.1](#]).  
**Customization**: Use local cases (e.g., soil erosion in Amazon, traffic congestion in urban hubs).

### Unit 4: Designing Regenerative Interventions
**Purpose**: Apply systems thinking to propose regenerative solutions, integrating with regenerative projects ([Section 3.3](#]).  
**Duration**: 2–3 hours.  
**Activities**:
1. **Community Project Design (90 min)**:
   - Groups select a local system challenge (e.g., polluted river, food insecurity).
   - Map the system (elements, loops, patterns) and propose a regenerative intervention (e.g., permaculture, water filtration).
   - Create a project plan using the regenerative project guide ([Section 10.1](#]), including roles and resources.
   - Equity: 50% marginalized leadership, oral plans for non-literate learners.
2. **Presentation and Feedback (45 min)**:
   - Groups present plans to peers and community members, using visuals, oral, or tactile formats.
   - Collect feedback via anonymous surveys or oral comments to refine plans.
   - Equity: Accessible presentation formats, safe spaces for feedback.
3. **Reflection (30 min)**:
   - Discuss: “How will our solution restore balance? Whose voices shaped it?”
   - Record in accessible formats.

**Materials**: Paper, markers, string, audio recorders, project guide template.  
**Assessment**: Project plan with system map and intervention (scored via M&E rubric, [Section 10.1](#]).  
**Customization**: Align with local priorities (e.g., mangrove restoration in coastal areas, urban gardens).

### Facilitation Guide
**Purpose**: Supports educators in delivering the module with equity and engagement ([Section 3.8](#]).  
**Tips**:
- **Preparation**: Complete 10-hour systems thinking training ([Section 3.8](#]), review regenerative project guide ([Section 10.1](#]).
- **Equity**: Ensure 50% marginalized participation, use multilingual prompts, and provide sensory-friendly spaces.
- **Engagement**: Use storytelling, games, and local examples to maintain interest.
- **Adaptation**: Adjust activities for age (e.g., simpler maps for ages 10–12, complex loops for 16–18) and context (e.g., rural vs. urban).
- **Safety**: Offer anonymous feedback and conflict resolution via restorative circles ([Section 3.4](#]).

### Assessment and Evaluation
**Purpose**: Tracks learner progress and module impact, aligning with M&E ([Section 5](#]).
