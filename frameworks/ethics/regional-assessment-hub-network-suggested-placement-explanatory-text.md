### Suggested Placement:

This visualization would be most effective when placed in **Section 3.2.1a Tiered Regional Assessment Hub Network**, immediately after the introductory paragraph and before the detailed description of the tiered coordination structure. It provides a visual overview of how the assessment network operates globally while highlighting the connections between different levels of governance.

The diagram should be introduced with text such as:

*"Figure 4: The Tiered Regional Assessment Hub Network illustrates our global approach to implementing AI consciousness assessment. This coordinated infrastructure ensures consistent evaluation standards while respecting regional diversity and addressing resource disparities. The network balances centralized methodology with decentralized implementation, enabling efficient assessment of AI systems across diverse geographic and cultural contexts."*

This visualization helps stakeholders understand how the abstract assessment principles from the previous section translate into practical governance structures. It emphasizes the framework's commitment to global coordination while respecting regional differences and addressing capacity disparities between regions. The visual representation makes clear how assessment responsibilities flow through the system and how specialized expertise is integrated into the evaluation process.
