# Appendix B: AUBI Implementation Playbook

This playbook provides practical guidance for implementing Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) to support global citizenship. It offers evidence-based strategies, funding models, and assessment frameworks that can be adapted to diverse contexts.

## 1. Funding Mechanisms for AUBI

Sustainable AUBI implementation requires identifying appropriate and stable funding sources. The table below compares various funding mechanisms that have been successfully implemented or thoroughly modeled.

| Funding Model | Description | Advantages | Challenges | Best For |
|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Carbon Dividend** | Tax on carbon emissions redistributed equally to all citizens | Aligns economic incentives with climate goals; progressive redistribution | Requires strong monitoring systems; potential industry resistance | Regions with high carbon emissions; areas needing economic transition |
| **Data Dividend** | Fee on data collection and AI training, shared with citizens who generated the data | Recognizes citizen contribution to digital economy; addresses tech concentration | Implementation complexity; international coordination | Digitally advanced economies; areas with tech hubs |
| **Financial Transaction Tax** | Small levy (0.1-0.5%) on financial transactions to fund basic income | Large revenue potential; reduces speculative trading; progressive impact | Requires coordination to prevent capital flight | Urban centers with financial sectors; regional economic zones |
| **Land Value Tax** | Tax on unimproved land value, capturing socially-created value | Discourages speculation; taxes immobile resource; difficult to avoid | Valuation challenges; transition impacts | Areas with high housing costs; rapidly developing regions |
| **Commons Revenue** | Payments for use of shared resources (water, airwaves, minerals) | Recognizes common ownership of natural resources; sustainable funding | Governance complexity; enforcement challenges | Resource-rich regions; areas with strong local governance |
| **Sovereign Wealth Fund** | Investment portfolio funded by public assets or resources | Creates long-term sustainable funding; can stabilize resource economies | Requires initial capital; political independence needed | Resource economies; places with public asset pools |

## 2. Phased Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (6-12 months)
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Identify and convene key stakeholders including potential recipients, local businesses, government agencies, and civil society organizations
- **Needs Assessment**: Conduct community-based research to identify specific needs, opportunities, and potential barriers to implementation
- **Funding Mechanism Selection**: Choose appropriate funding model(s) based on local context and available resources
- **Legal Framework Development**: Draft necessary policies, regulations, or legislation to enable implementation
- **Digital Infrastructure Assessment**: Evaluate existing payment systems and digital infrastructure necessary for implementation

### Phase 2: Pilot Program Design (3-6 months)
- **Participant Selection**: Determine initial scope (geographic area, demographics, or random selection)
- **Payment Structure**: Decide on amount, frequency, and delivery mechanism
- **Complementary Programs**: Identify supporting services (financial literacy, entrepreneurship support)
- **Monitoring Framework**: Establish baseline measures and data collection systems
- **Operational Team**: Assemble and train implementation team with diverse expertise

### Phase 3: Implementation (12-24 months)
