# Aged Population Support Framework Outline

## Executive Summary
- **Vision**: Empower aging populations as active contributors to equitable, sustainable economies, ensuring dignity, inclusion, and resilience through innovative economic, social, and governance systems.
- **Approach**: Integrates elder-focused economic tools (e.g., Adaptive Universal Basic Income), social programs (e.g., youth-elder cohorts), and global governance to support aging populations, distinct from traditional pension systems or isolated eldercare models.
- **Goals**: Achieve 50% elder economic inclusion, 80% social integration, 90% healthcare access, and 70% global policy adoption by 2035.
- **Key Features**: AUBI for elder contributions, Elder Innovation Hubs, youth-elder councils, global aging crisis protocols, transparent governance.
- **Stakeholders**: Elders, youth, municipalities, NGOs, UN, indigenous communities, with pilots starting in 2026.

## 1. Introduction
   - **Purpose**: Create a framework to support aging populations through economic empowerment, social inclusion, and global coordination.
   - **Scope**: Address challenges of aging (economic exclusion, social isolation, healthcare access) within a nested sovereignty model.
   - **Distinctions**:
     - *Vs. Traditional Pensions*: Dynamic AUBI rewards elder contributions (e.g., caregiving).
     - *Vs. Eldercare Models*: Holistic integration across economic, social, and cultural domains.
     - *Vs. Universal Basic Income*: Adaptive, contribution-based for elders.
   - **Goals**: Economic resilience, social connection, healthcare equity, cultural transformation for aging populations.
   - **Key Principles**:
     - <span style="color: blue;">Dignity</span>: Elders as wisdom keepers and contributors.
     - <span style="color: green;">Inclusion</span>: Intergenerational and cross-cultural integration.
     - <span style="color: red;">Equity</span>: Accessible economic and healthcare systems.
     - <span style="color: purple;">Resilience</span>: Adaptive systems for crises.
   - **Visualization**: Nested systems diagram (green local elder circles, blue regional networks, red global aging sphere, arrows for flows).
   - **Key Actors**: Elder councils, youth networks, municipalities, NGOs, UN, indigenous groups.
   - **Minimum Requirements**: Basic digital access (mobile/SMS), transparent reporting, elder-accessible interfaces.
   - **Quick Start Guide**:
     1. Launch an AUBI pilot for elder caregiving using the AUBI Implementation Guide.
     2. Establish a Youth-Elder Twinned Learning Cohort.
     3. Join the global platform at agingframework.org.
