## Implementation Tools

### Decision Allocation Assessment
Use this framework to determine the appropriate governance level for specific issues:

1. **Issue Identification**
  - Clearly define the issue and its boundaries
  - Identify all stakeholders affected

2. **Impact Analysis**
  - Map primary, secondary, and tertiary impacts
  - Assess geographical and temporal scope

3. **Capability Assessment**
  - Evaluate resources needed for effective governance
  - Assess existing capacity at different levels

4. **Subsidiarity Test**
  - Determine if the issue can be handled at a lower level
  - Document reasoning for higher-level governance when needed

5. **Implementation Planning**
  - Design coordination mechanisms between levels
  - Create clear roles and responsibilities
