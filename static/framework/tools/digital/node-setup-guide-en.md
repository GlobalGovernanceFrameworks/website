# Node Setup Guide: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This guide provides step-by-step instructions for establishing and operating a Local Citizen Node within the *Digital Commons Framework*, enabling communities to govern digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—through decentralized, participatory processes. Designed for diverse contexts, from rural villages to urban neighborhoods, it offers multiple implementation paths requiring minimal resources and technical knowledge. Rooted in historical commons practices (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy, medieval European commons) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 16), it ensures cultural relevance, inclusivity, and resilience for effective community governance.

## Overview
A Local Citizen Node is the foundational unit of the Digital Commons Framework, where communities directly govern shared digital resources through transparent, inclusive processes. This guide outlines how to establish operational nodes that balance local needs with global standards, offering multiple implementation paths:

- **Minimal-Viable Node**: Paper/SMS-based governance requiring only a notebook, pen, and basic phone.
- **Ultra-Lightweight Digital Implementation**: GitHub-based approach using existing tools with minimal costs (~$15/year).
- **Standard Implementation**: Balance of digital and offline tools with modest infrastructure.
- **Enhanced Implementation**: Full digital infrastructure with mesh networks and enhanced security.

The guide ensures inclusivity through multilingual resources (50 languages by 2030), accessibility tools (audio, braille formats), and cultural adaptability for diverse contexts, while targeting:

- **Establishment**: 5,000 operational nodes globally by 2035.
- **Participation**: 50% adult community engagement by 2035.
- **Transparency**: 100% of decisions publicly documented by 2030.
- **Resilience**: 90% node uptime during disruptions by 2032.

## Pre-Setup Assessment
Before establishing a node, conduct this brief assessment to tailor implementation to your community's context.

1. **Community Context Assessment**:
   - **Population Size**: Record approximate community size (small: <100, medium: 100-1,000, large: >1,000).
   - **Geographic Distribution**: Note if community is concentrated or dispersed.
   - **Existing Governance**: Document traditional decision-making processes for potential integration.
   - **Example**: Senegal's village of 300 people integrated elder councils into node governance.

2. **Resource Inventory**:
   - **Technology Access**: Assess available devices (phones, computers, internet connectivity).
   - **Literacy Levels**: Note literacy rates and preferred communication methods.
   - **Infrastructure**: Identify meeting spaces, power sources, connectivity options.
   - **Example**: Rwanda node began with 3 feature phones, 1 tablet, and solar charging.

3. **Priority Identification**:
   - **Community Needs**: Survey for priority digital resources (e.g., health data, educational content).
   - **Quick Wins**: Identify immediate benefits that can build momentum.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Note aspirational objectives for 3-5 year planning.
   - **Example**: Bangladesh prioritized climate data access for immediate flood prediction benefits.

4. **Implementation Path Selection**:
   - Based on assessment, select the most appropriate path:
     - **Path A**: Minimal-Viable (limited tech, primarily offline governance).
     - **Path B**: Ultra-Lightweight (basic internet, GitHub-based approach).
     - **Path C**: Standard (mixed digital/offline, some local infrastructure).
     - **Path D**: Enhanced (primarily digital, mesh networks, secure infrastructure).
   - **Example**: Brazil selected Path B initially, evolving to Path C within one year.
