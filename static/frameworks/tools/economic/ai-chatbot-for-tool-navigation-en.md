## 3. User Experience Design

### Interaction Examples
*Note: These sample dialogues represent the planned functionality and will be refined during development*

#### Tool Selection Example
```
User: "I want to start a community currency but don't know where to begin."

Chatbot: "I can help with that! Starting a community currency involves several steps. 
Would you like to:
1. Learn the basic concepts first
2. See a step-by-step implementation guide
3. View case studies of successful currencies
4. Find templates for currency design"

User: "I'd like the step-by-step guide."

Chatbot: "Great choice! The Community Currency Design Template in the Economic 
Integration Seed Kit provides comprehensive guidance. Here's a preview of the 
implementation steps:
1. Form a currency design team (with diverse representation)
2. Define your currency's purpose and goals
3. Select appropriate backing mechanisms
4. Design governance structures
5. Create issuance and circulation rules

Would you like me to send you the full template, explain any of these steps in 
more detail, or connect you with a mentor community?"
```

#### Concept Clarification Example
```
User: "What does sovereignty mean in this framework?"

Chatbot: "In the Nested Sovereignty Framework, sovereignty refers to a community's 
ability to make its own economic decisions while participating in broader systems.

Key aspects include:
• Local control over currency design and issuance
• Community governance of shared resources (commons)
• Participatory decision-making about local economic priorities
• Balancing local autonomy with regional and global coordination

This differs from isolation - communities maintain connections with other scales 
through interoperability protocols.

Would you like examples of how sovereignty works in practice, or would you prefer 
to see how it connects to the other core principles?"
```

#### Troubleshooting Example
```
User: "Our community currency isn't circulating well. People get it but don't spend it."

Chatbot: "That's a common challenge! Here are some proven approaches to improve 
currency circulation:

1. Increase acceptance points - Are there enough places to spend the currency?
2. Create regular spending opportunities - Community markets or services
3. Check your issuance method - How does currency enter circulation?
4. Consider demurrage features - Time-based value adjustments
5. Strengthen trust through transparency - Clear backing and governance

The Bristol Pound overcame similar challenges by partnering with local government 
for tax payments and public services.

Would you like specific guidance on any of these approaches, or should I connect 
you with a mentor community that solved similar circulation issues?"
```

#### Low-Resource Context Example
```
User: "We have very little money and no computers. Can we still use this framework?"

Chatbot: "Absolutely! The framework has Minimum Viable Implementation pathways 
designed specifically for resource-constrained contexts.

For your situation, I recommend:
• Paper-based currency systems requiring minimal startup costs
• Simple cooperative structures using existing community meetings
• Basic commons agreements documented through verbal and written records

The Economic Micro-Grant Template could help secure small funding ($500-1,500) 
to begin implementation.

Many communities have successfully started with zero budget using the volunteer-based 
approach described in the "Minimum Viable Implementation Pathways" section.

Would you like me to outline the specific first steps that require no financial 
resources, or would you prefer information about the micro-grant process?"
```
