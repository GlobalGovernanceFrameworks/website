## CORE PRINCIPLES FOR CRISIS ETHICS

1. **Preserve Life First**
   - Prioritize immediate survival needs across all categories of beings
   - Default to protection when rapid assessment is impossible

2. **Minimize Suffering**
   - Prevent avoidable suffering for all sentient beings
   - Apply proportional attention to suffering based on capacity and scale

3. **Maintain Transparency**
   - Document decisions even under pressure
   - Communicate rationale when possible

4. **Balance Immediate Action with Long-Term Impact**
   - Consider reversible vs. irreversible harms
   - Create space for fuller assessment when crisis stabilizes

5. **Respect Cultural Context**
   - Integrate local knowledge and values
   - Adapt implementation to cultural realities

## QUICK RESPONSE FLOWCHARTS

### GENERAL CRISIS RESPONSE PATHWAY

```
START → Identify affected beings → Survival threats? → YES → Apply life preservation protocol
                                                     → NO → Suffering threats? → YES → Apply harm reduction protocol
                                                                               → NO → Rights violation threats? → YES → Apply protection protocol
                                                                                                               → NO → Monitor situation
```

### BALANCING COMPETING RIGHTS IN CRISIS

```
Competing rights identified → Survival at stake? → YES → Prioritize survival needs
                                                 → NO → Reversible harm? → YES → Consider temporary compromise
                                                                         → NO → Apply precautionary principle
                                                                                 Engage affected stakeholders if possible
                                                                                 Document decision and rationale
```

### DECISION AUTHORITY IN CRISIS

```
Decision needed → Official authority present? → YES → Coordinate with authority
                                              → NO → Guardian council available? → YES → Engage guardians
                                                                                → NO → Local leadership available? → YES → Collaborate with leaders
                                                                                                                  → NO → Exercise best judgment
                                                                                                                          Document decisions
                                                                                                                          Prepare for review
