# Climate-Health Adaptation Guide

**Document Purpose**: This guide provides a roadmap for adapting health systems to climate change impacts under the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework*. It supports the Global Health Equity Council, Regional Health Hubs, and Community Health Legions in building resilient, equitable health systems to address risks like extreme weather, vector-borne diseases, and food insecurity, prioritizing LMICs and marginalized communities. The guide is designed for health workers, environmental scientists, policymakers, regional coordinators, and community leaders to implement climate-resilient health interventions.

## <a id="risk-assessment-and-planning"></a>Risk Assessment and Planning

Risk assessment identifies priority climate-health vulnerabilities.

### Steps
1. **Risk Mapping** (1-2 Months):
   - Assess climate hazards (e.g., heatwaves, floods, disease vectors) using One Health data, per *One Health Surveillance Protocols*.
   - Map vulnerable populations (e.g., LMIC, coastal communities, indigenous groups).
   - Engage communities for local risk insights, per *Community Engagement Toolkit*.
2. **Vulnerability Analysis**:
