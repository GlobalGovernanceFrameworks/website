# Global Governance Framework Documentation Style Guide

## Purpose and Scope

This style guide establishes consistent standards for all Global Governance Framework documentation. It aims to:

- Ensure coherent presentation across all frameworks
- Improve readability and accessibility
- Facilitate multilingual translation
- Support efficient content development and maintenance
- Enable users to navigate seamlessly between frameworks

These guidelines apply to all new content creation and should be gradually implemented when updating existing documentation.

## Document Structure

### 1. Framework Organization

- **Framework Index**: Each framework must include an `index.md` file providing an overview, section links, and navigation guidance
- **Section Files**: Individual sections stored as separate markdown files following consistent naming patterns
- **Tools Directory**: Implementation tools stored in a `/tools/` subdirectory
- **Seed Kit**: Core implementation resources grouped in a `/seed-kit/` subdirectory

### 2. Section Hierarchy and Numbering

Every framework must follow a consistent section hierarchy:

1. **Preamble/Introduction**: Vision, purpose, and context
2. **Core Principles**: Foundational values and frameworks
3. **Structural Components**: Key systems and mechanisms
4. **Implementation Approaches**: Practical deployment strategies
5. **Metrics and Evaluation**: Assessment frameworks
6. **Supporting Sections**: Specific to framework needs
7. **Appendices**: Supplementary details

Numbering should follow these patterns:
- **Major sections**: Use sequential numbers (e.g., `01-introduction.md`, `02-core-principles.md`)
- **Subsections**: For document organization, use decimal notation (e.g., 2.1, 2.2)

### 3. Standard Section Components

Every section should include these elements:

```markdown
---
title: Section Title
section: section-id
---

# Section Title

**In this section:**
- [Subsection One](#subsection-one)
- [Subsection Two](#subsection-two)
- [Subsection Three](#subsection-three)

**Estimated Reading Time**: X minutes

Brief introduction paragraph that summarizes the section's purpose and content.

## <a id="subsection-one"></a>Subsection One

Content goes here...
```

### 3. Case Studies and Examples

Format all case studies consistently:

```markdown
**Case Study [Type]**: [Title]

[Region/Organization], [Year Range] implemented [approach] addressing [challenge]. Key outcomes included [measurable results]. This example demonstrates [principle/lesson relevant to framework].

**Example [Type]**: In Rwanda's post-genocide MHPSS initiatives, community-based sociotherapy facilitated collective healing for over 120,000 participants, processing 1.9 million cases while improving mental health and conflict management capacities.
```

Where [Type] should be:
- **(Real)** for documented, evidence-based implementations with verified outcomes
- **(Fictive)** for illustrative examples that demonstrate potential applications but haven't been implemented

All case studies should clearly indicate their type, with both real and fictive examples serving distinct purposes:
- **Real case studies** provide empirical evidence of successful implementation and should include specific metrics, time periods, and documented outcomes
- **Fictive case studies** illustrate potential applications in hypothetical scenarios and should be plausible, internally consistent, and clearly aligned with framework principles

The framework should strive to include both types, with real examples demonstrating proven approaches and fictive examples showcasing potential applications in contexts where implementation is still emerging.


### 4. Cross-References

Use consistent cross-reference formats:

```markdown
<!-- Within same framework -->
[Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/digital#core-principles)

<!-- To other frameworks -->
[Climate & Energy Governance](/frameworks/docs/implementation/energy)

<!-- To tools -->
[Conflict Analysis Framework](/frameworks/tools/peace/conflict-analysis-framework-en.pdf)
```

### 5. URL Path Structure and Naming

URLs are a critical part of framework accessibility, navigation, and search optimization. Follow these guidelines for consistent and effective path structures:

#### Path Naming Principles

- **Clarity over brevity**: Use descriptive paths that clearly indicate content purpose, even if slightly longer
  - Preferred: `/environmental-stewardship` 
  - Avoid: `/environment` (too general)

- **Kebab-case format**: Use hyphens to separate words in all URL paths
  - Correct: `/water-energy-food-nexus`
  - Avoid: `/waterenergyfood` or `/water_energy_food`

- **Hierarchical structure**: Organize paths to reflect content hierarchy
  - Framework sections: `/frameworks/environmental-stewardship`
  - Tools within frameworks: `/frameworks/environmental-stewardship/tools`

- **Avoid unnecessary terms**: Remove articles and common prepositions
  - Preferred: `/stakeholder-engagement`
  - Avoid: `/the-stakeholder-engagement-guide`

#### Implementation Recommendations

- **Redirect strategy**: Implement redirects from shorter or logical alternative paths to canonical URLs
  - Example: `/environment` redirects to `/environmental-stewardship`

- **Language handling**: Language selection is managed via the site header selector, not in URL paths
  - Content is organized in the repository by language subdirectories (e.g., `/en/`, `/sv/`)
  - Public-facing URLs remain language-agnostic, with the user's language preference determining which content is displayed

- **Version indicators**: Include version numbers for versioned documentation when applicable
  - Example: `/environmental-stewardship/v2/implementation`

- **URL stability**: Once published, maintain URL paths even if titles change to prevent broken links
  - Implement redirects if structural changes are necessary

- **Path depth**: Limit path depth to 3-4 levels maximum for usability
  - Manageable: `/frameworks/environmental-stewardship/tools/seed-kit`
  - Avoid: `/frameworks/environmental/stewardship/implementation/tools/community/seed-kit`

Following these guidelines ensures that URLs contribute to overall framework usability, discoverability, and long-term maintenance while establishing a consistent pattern across all digital resources.

### 6. Contact Information and Resource References

**Development Status Transparency:**
All framework tools and documentation must accurately represent the current development status of resources and contact information. Use clear status indicators and avoid creating false expectations about non-existent services.

**Current Infrastructure Reference:**
- **Primary Contact**: globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com

- Test all contact methods and links before publication
- Include version dates and next review schedules for contact information sections

**Example Implementations:**
See Community Welfare Readiness Assessment, Welfare Transition Planning Template, and Cultural Adaptation Protocol Guide for consistent implementation examples.

## Content Formatting

### 1. Headings

- **Section Titles**: Use H1 (`#`) only once per file
- **Subsections**: Use H2 (`##`) as the primary division
- **Deep Nesting**: Use H3-H5 (`###`, `####`, `#####`) for nested content
- **Heading Style**: Use title case for all headings
- **ID Anchors**: Add `<a id="anchor-name"></a>` before headings for cross-references

### 2. Text Formatting

- **Emphasis**: Use bold (`**text**`) for definitions, key points, and important terms
- **Italics**: Use italics (`*text*`) for foreign terms or mild emphasis
- **Lists**: Use unordered lists for collections without sequence; ordered lists for sequential steps
- **Blockquotes**: Use for case examples, quotes, and highlighted insights

Example:
```markdown
**Implementation Timeline** represents the scheduled progression of activities. *Teoria nodi* (node theory) informs this approach.

Key activities include:
- Stakeholder mapping
- Resource assessment
- Governance establishment

Follow these steps in order:
1. Form the core team
2. Conduct baseline assessment
3. Deploy initial mechanisms
```

### 3. Case Studies and Examples

Format all case studies consistently:

```markdown
**Case Study**: [Title]

[Region/Organization], [Year Range] implemented [approach] addressing [challenge]. Key outcomes included [measurable results]. This example demonstrates [principle/lesson relevant to framework].

**Example**: In Rwanda's post-genocide MHPSS initiatives, community-based sociotherapy facilitated collective healing for over 120,000 participants, processing 1.9 million cases while improving mental health and conflict management capacities.
```

### 4. Implementation Guidance

- **Naming Convention**: `[framework]-[concept]-[diagram-type].svg`
- **Color Palette**: Use the established color scheme (primary: #3A6EA5, #6DAA3F, #C43B3B, #F5A623)
- **Alt Text**: All diagrams must include descriptive alt text

### 2. Tables

Format tables with header row emphasis:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Content  | Content  | Content  |
```

### 3. User Interface Elements

- **Buttons**: Reference using bold with descriptive text, e.g., **Submit Form button**
- **Fields**: Reference using italics, e.g., *Email Address field*
- **Menu Paths**: Use > to indicate navigation, e.g., Settings > Preferences > Notifications

## Terminology and Language

### 1. Voice and Tone

- **Voice**: Authoritative yet accessible; balancing technical precision with clarity
- **Tone**: Hopeful and action-oriented, emphasizing possibility while acknowledging challenges
- **Perspective**: Use third person for frameworks ("The framework provides...") and second person for guidance ("You can implement...")

### 2. Common Terms

Standardize these key terms across all frameworks:

| Term | Definition | Usage Notes |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Framework | The complete governance system for a domain | Capitalize when referring to specific frameworks |
| Implementation | The process of deploying framework components | Use "implementation" not "execution" |
| Governance | The systems for decision-making and accountability | Distinguish from "government" |
| Stakeholder | Any entity affected by or influencing the framework | Be specific about stakeholder types when possible |
| Node | A local implementation unit | Consistent across all frameworks |
| Hub | A regional coordination entity | Consistent across all frameworks |
| Council | A governing body at any level | Specify level (Local, Regional, Global) |

### 3. Abbreviations and Acronyms

- Define all acronyms on first use in each document: "Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)"
- Create glossary sections in framework indexes for reference
- Minimize acronym usage in user-facing documentation

### 4. Inclusive Language

- Use gender-neutral terms (e.g., "humanity" not "mankind")
- Represent diverse examples from various regions and cultures
- Avoid culturally specific metaphors that may not translate well
- Use person-first language for disabilities when appropriate

## Technical Standards

# Framework Development & Positioning Guidelines
## Addition to Global Governance Framework Documentation Style Guide

### Framework Authority & Development Positioning

All Global Governance Framework documentation must accurately represent the development methodology and authority level while maintaining appropriate confidence in the substantive research and analysis contained within each framework.

#### Development Methodology Description

**Standard Language for Framework Development**:
Use consistent language across all frameworks to describe the development approach:

```markdown
**Framework Development**: This [framework/guide/toolkit] is part of the Global Governance Framework initiative, developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok, and Gemini) to achieve comprehensive research synthesis and maximize diversity of analytical perspectives.

**Research Foundation**: The framework integrates evidence-based practices, international best practices, and established [domain-specific] principles while [specific focus area, e.g., "honoring diverse cultural approaches" or "prioritizing community sovereignty"].
```

#### Authority Level Positioning

**Appropriate Confidence Level**:
- **Acknowledge Individual Development**: Be transparent that frameworks are developed by an individual researcher
- **Emphasize Research Rigor**: Highlight the iterative AI refinement process and evidence integration
- **Maintain Intellectual Humility**: Include appropriate caveats about local adaptation needs
- **Assert Substantive Value**: Present frameworks as serious contributions based on comprehensive analysis

**Avoid**:
- Overly institutional language that implies organizational authority not yet established
- Excessive disclaimers that undermine the substantial research foundation
- Claims of operational programs or services not yet available
- False modesty that diminishes legitimate research contributions

#### Context-Specific Applications

**For Framework Overviews and Major Documents**:
```markdown
**Development Note**: This framework represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems, integrating evidence-based practices with [domain-specific approaches]. While developed by an individual researcher, the framework draws from established [relevant field] principles and international best practices.

**Implementation Guidance**: The framework provides research-based guidance for [specific application]. Local implementation should involve consultation with [relevant stakeholders] familiar with specific contexts and requirements.
```

**For Implementation Tools and Practical Guides**:
```markdown
**Framework Foundation**: This [tool/guide] is part of the [Framework Name], developed through iterative research synthesis and AI-assisted analysis to integrate best practices with [specific focus].

**Local Adaptation**: While grounded in research and established practices, implementation should involve consultation with [relevant local experts] familiar with specific cultural, legal, and contextual requirements.
```

**For Conceptual or Theoretical Sections**:
```markdown
**Research Approach**: This analysis represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement across multiple AI systems to maximize analytical diversity and evidence integration.

**Theoretical Framework**: While conceptual, this framework draws from established [relevant field] research and international best practices in [specific area].
```

#### Stakeholder Engagement Language

**When Describing Consultation Needs**:
- Use "should involve consultation with" rather than "requires validation by"
- Specify relevant stakeholder types (e.g., "mental health professionals," "community leaders," "traditional healers")
- Emphasize collaboration rather than subordination to external authority
- Maintain framework integrity while acknowledging local expertise needs

**When Describing Implementation Support**:
- Be honest about current capacity and availability
- Use development status indicators (âœ… Currently Available, ðŸš§ In Development)
- Provide clear contact information and realistic response expectations
- Avoid promising services or support not yet operational

#### Research Citation and Evidence Base

**When Referencing Research**:
- Distinguish between real case studies (documented implementations) and conceptual examples (illustrative scenarios)
- Use **(Real)** and **(Conceptual)** indicators for case studies
- Cite specific research when available while acknowledging synthesis nature of framework development
- Present evidence integration as strength rather than limitation

**Research Synthesis Language**:
```markdown
This framework integrates research findings from [specific sources when available] with analysis across multiple domains to provide comprehensive guidance for [specific application]. The iterative development process across multiple AI systems ensures diverse analytical perspectives and comprehensive evidence consideration.
```

#### Quality and Rigor Indicators

**Emphasize Analytical Rigor**:
- Highlight the iterative refinement process as quality assurance
- Note the multi-AI approach as ensuring diverse perspectives
- Emphasize evidence integration and synthesis methodology
- Present comprehensive scope as analytical strength

**Acknowledge Limitations Appropriately**:
- Note individual development while emphasizing research foundation
- Include local adaptation needs without undermining framework value
- Acknowledge evolving nature of frameworks while maintaining current utility
- Balance humility with confidence in substantive contributions

#### Consistency Across Frameworks

**Maintain Parallel Structure**:
- Use similar positioning language across all frameworks
- Adapt stakeholder consultation language to domain-specific needs
- Maintain consistent tone and authority level across documents
- Ensure development status transparency across all materials

**Domain-Specific Adaptations**:
- **Mental Health**: Emphasize lived experience integration and cultural competency needs
- **Environmental**: Highlight indigenous knowledge and local ecological expertise
- **Economic**: Note policy and implementation complexity requiring local adaptation
- **Technology**: Emphasize community sovereignty and digital rights considerations

#### Version Control and Updates

**Framework Evolution Language**:
```markdown
**Living Document Status**: This framework is designed for continuous improvement based on implementation experience and emerging research. Current version represents comprehensive analysis as of [date] with regular updates planned based on feedback and new developments.
```

**Update Protocols**:
- Include version numbers and dates for major updates
- Maintain changelog for significant modifications
- Preserve core positioning language across versions
- Update development status indicators as capacity grows

### Implementation Checklist

When creating new framework documents, ensure:

- [ ] Appropriate development methodology description included
- [ ] Authority level accurately represented (neither overstated nor understated)
- [ ] Local adaptation needs specified without undermining framework value
- [ ] Current capacity honestly represented with development status indicators
- [ ] Research foundation emphasized while acknowledging individual development
- [ ] Domain-specific stakeholder consultation needs clearly specified
- [ ] Contact information realistic and currently available
- [ ] Consistent tone and positioning with other framework documents

### Examples of Effective Positioning

**Strong Positioning (Recommended)**:
> "This framework represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems, integrating evidence-based practices with community-led approaches. While developed by an individual researcher, the framework draws from established mental health principles and international best practices."

**Weak Positioning (Avoid)**:
> "This is just a theoretical framework developed by one person and should not be taken seriously without extensive professional validation."

**Overstated Positioning (Avoid)**:
> "This framework represents the definitive approach to global mental health governance, developed by our comprehensive research team with extensive operational experience."

**Balanced Positioning (Recommended)**:
> "The framework provides research-based guidance for community mental health transformation. Local implementation should involve consultation with mental health professionals, community leaders, and traditional healers familiar with specific cultural and legal contexts."

This positioning approach maintains intellectual honesty while asserting the legitimate value of comprehensive research synthesis and multi-perspective analytical development.

**IMPORTANT**: Save the framework positioning for the end where it provides helpful context without interrupting the main content flow to avoid reader fatigue.
