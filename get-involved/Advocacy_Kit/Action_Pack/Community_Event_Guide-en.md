### **Part 2: Discussion Guide**

Choose one or two topics to focus on, or move through them all for a comprehensive overview.

#### **Topic 1: The Problem - How the "Polycrisis" Affects Us**

  * **Introduction:** Explain that the GGF is a response to the "polycrisis"—interconnected failures in our climate, economic, and political systems. Mention that the cost of inaction is enormous, with climate change alone projected to cause $54 trillion in economic losses.
  * **Discussion Questions:**
    1.  How do you see these global issues (like climate change, supply chain disruptions, or economic instability) impacting our local community?
    2.  The framework states our current global systems were designed for a world that no longer exists. Do you agree? In what ways have you seen this failure in our community?
    3.  Which global challenge worries you the most for the future of our community and our families?

#### **Topic 2: The Solutions - New Voices & Real Accountability**

  * **Introduction:** Introduce two key pillars of the GGF: reforming institutions to unlock action and integrating new voices for democratic legitimacy. Mention specific reforms like the **UNSC Veto Override** to enable crisis response and the **Global Citizens' Initiative** to give people a direct say in global rules.
  * **Discussion Questions:**
    1.  If you could participate in a global referendum (the Global Citizens' Initiative), what is the first issue you would want to vote on?
    2.  The framework gives formal roles to cities and local regions in global governance. How could our city/town contribute to solving a global problem like climate change?
    3.  The framework proposes an "Ecocide Law" to hold polluters accountable. How would having strong, enforceable environmental laws at the global level help protect our local environment?

#### **Topic 3: Making It Real - From Global Ideas to Local Action**

  * **Introduction:** Explain that the GGF is designed to be implemented pragmatically, starting with a coalition of willing nations and cities. Emphasize the principle of **Subsidiarity**, which means decisions are always made at the lowest effective level, protecting local control.
  * **Discussion Questions:**
    1.  What is one local challenge our community is facing that requires broader, coordinated action to solve (e.g., pollution from a neighboring area, economic competition)?
    2.  How can we, as a community, get involved in this global conversation? What would be our first step?
    3.  Who are the key people and organizations in our community that should hear about this framework?
