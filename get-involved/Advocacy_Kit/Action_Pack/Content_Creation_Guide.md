# Content Creation Guide: Share Your Vision for a Better World

Your voice, your art, and your stories are essential for building a global movement. The Global Governance Frameworks project is not just about policy; it's about creating a new story for humanity's future. We invite you to help tell that story.

This guide is designed to help you create your own blog posts, videos, artwork, or any other content inspired by the vision of a more resilient and just world.

### **Content Prompts & Ideas**

Here are some ideas to get you started. Feel free to use them as inspiration or come up with your own unique angle.

**1. The "Polycrisis" in My Community**

  * The framework talks about a "polycrisis" of interconnected global failures. Tell a personal story. How have you seen climate change, economic instability, or political division affect your local community? What does governance failure look like from your perspective?

**2. A Vision for a Resilient Future**

  * The ultimate goal is to build a "resilience-generating" civilization. What does that look like to you? Create a piece of art, a short story, or a video that imagines a future where our systems support ecological integrity and human flourishing.

**3. Why This Principle Matters to Me**

  * Choose one of the **[Seven Core Principles](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/docs/implementation/treaty-for-our-only-home#02-core-principles)**, like "Ecological Integrity & Intergenerational Equity" or "Democratic Legitimacy & Inclusivity". Explain in a blog post why that specific principle is critical for the future you want to see.

**4. Explaining a Keystone Reform**

  * Take one of the five keystone reforms, such as **Ecocide Law** or the **Global Carbon Tax**, and create a short, simple explainer video or infographic. How would this reform make a tangible difference in the world?

**5. Art for a New Governance**

  * Create a visual piece—a painting, digital illustration, sculpture, or photograph—that represents one of the core ideas of the framework. This could be the Five Pillars working together, the concept of "polycentrism," or humanity acting as stewards of our only home.
