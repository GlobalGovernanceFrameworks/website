# Global Governance Frameworks - Brand Guidelines

### Introduction

Our brand is a visual representation of our mission: to build the infrastructure for a more cooperative, resilient, and future-ready world. Consistent and correct use of our brand assets ensures that our message is clear, professional, and instantly recognizable.

These guidelines provide the necessary information to use our brand assets correctly.

### Our Logo

We have two primary brand marks: the **Full Logo** and the **Icon**.

1.  **The Full Logo** is our primary mark. It is a detailed visual metaphor for our philosophy of multi-level, interconnected governance. It should be used in most applications where space allows.
2.  **The Icon** is a simplified version of our logo, designed for use in small spaces like favicons, social media profiles, and other applications where the Full Logo would be illegible.

### Logo Variations & Usage

To ensure legibility and consistency across all backgrounds, we provide three color variations for both the Full Logo and the Icon.

**1. Full Color (Primary)**
* This is the preferred version and should be used whenever possible.
* **Usage:** Best used on white or very light-colored backgrounds.

**2. Monochrome White**
* This version is exclusively for use on dark or busy colored backgrounds where the Full Color logo would not have sufficient contrast.
* **Usage:** Use on dark backgrounds, brand-color backgrounds, or on photographs.

**3. Monochrome Black**
* This version is for single-color applications on light backgrounds.
* **Usage:** Best for black-and-white documents (e.g., reports, letterheads) or on light backgrounds where a minimalist aesthetic is desired.

### Clear Space

To ensure our logo's integrity and visibility, always maintain a minimum amount of clear space around it. This space should be free of any other text, graphics, or distracting elements.

The minimum clear space is defined by the height of the central blue circle in the icon. This rule applies to both the Full Logo and the Icon.

### Logo Misuse

Our brand's strength depends on its consistent application. Please do not alter the logo in any of the following ways:

* **Do not** change the colors or gradients.
* **Do not** stretch, condense, or distort the logo's proportions.
* **Do not** rotate the logo.
* **Do not** add drop shadows, glows, or other visual effects.
* **Do not** place the logo on a background that does not provide sufficient contrast.
* **Do not** use the Full Logo in a space so small that it becomes illegible; use the Icon instead.

### Our Color Palette

Our color palette is inspired by the natural and cosmic systems our work aims to support.

* **Primary Blue (Cosmic):** `#2B4B8C`
* **Primary Green (Earthy):** `#2D5F2D`
* **Primary Gold (Highlight):** `#DAA520`
* **Secondary Violet (Cosmic Accent):** `#6B5CA5`
* **Secondary Brown (Roots):** `#654321`

### Typography

Consistent typography is key to a unified brand voice. Our primary typeface is **Inter**. It is an open-source font available on Google Fonts, chosen for its excellent readability on screens.

* **Headings:** Inter Bold
* **Body Text:** Inter Regular
