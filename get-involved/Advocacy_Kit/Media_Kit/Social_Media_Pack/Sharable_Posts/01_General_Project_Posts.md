**Post 1: The Mission**

**Text:**
Our world faces complex, interconnected challenges—a "polycrisis" that our current systems are not equipped to handle. The Global Governance Frameworks project is tackling this head-on.

We are not building a single world government. Instead, we are creating the open-source tools and frameworks to help different governance systems interoperate, share lessons, and evolve together. It’s about building the infrastructure for a more resilient future.
