# Global Governance Frameworks - community & outreach guide

Welcome to the Global Governance Frameworks community outreach program! This guide will help you become an effective advocate and connector, sharing our vision for cooperative, resilient governance systems with communities worldwide.

## üåç Why outreach matters

The Global Governance Frameworks addresses humanity's interconnected challenges through tools that enable different governance systems to interoperate and evolve together. Our frameworks are most powerful when they are shared, discussed, and implemented by diverse communities. Your voice and network are essential for making this transformation happen.

Think of yourself as a bridge-builder in the truest sense. Every conversation you have, every piece of content you create, and every connection you make helps build the infrastructure for a more cooperative world. Whether you're sharing a single social media post or organizing a community workshop, you're contributing to a global movement for better governance.

## üìã Getting started

Before diving into outreach activities, take some time to familiarize yourself with our core frameworks and messaging. Review the Treaty for Our Only Home and explore the implementation guides that resonate most with your interests. Join our Discord community to connect with other advocates and see what outreach efforts are already underway.

Consider what unique perspective you bring to this work. Are you passionate about local government? Do you have connections in academia or civil society? Are you skilled at visual design or video creation? Your background and interests will help determine where you can make the biggest impact.

## üéØ Core messaging principles

When you talk about the Global Governance Frameworks, consistency helps people understand our mission and builds trust in our approach. Here are the key concepts to communicate effectively.

**Our mission** is to create tools, patterns, and frameworks that enable different governance systems to interoperate. We're not proposing a single solution but building the infrastructure that allows many models to coexist, communicate, and collaborate. This distinction is crucial because it positions us as facilitators rather than prescriptive authorities.

**The challenge we address** is what scholars call the polycrisis‚Äîcascading failures in our climate, economic, and political systems that are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. Our work provides a coordinated response to this civilizational crisis by offering practical tools for cooperation and coordination.

**Our approach** is grounded in three core values: radical transparency (openness in all our processes), subsidiarity (decisions made at the most local appropriate level), and relational integrity (building trust through consistent, honest engagement). We aim for what we call a civilization of stewardship and conscience.

When communicating these ideas, focus on being solution-oriented rather than problem-focused. Emphasize cooperation between different systems rather than replacement of existing structures. Ground your discussions in concrete examples and implementation strategies, and always translate complex governance concepts into language your audience can understand.

## üöÄ Pathways for contribution

There are many ways to contribute to our outreach efforts, from creating a single piece of content to building ongoing relationships with key organizations. Choose the pathway that best matches your skills, interests, and available time.

### Content creation and sharing

Your creativity can help translate complex governance ideas into engaging, accessible content that reaches new audiences and deepens understanding among existing supporters.

**Social media and digital content** offers immediate ways to get involved. You might start by sharing framework summaries with your personal commentary, explaining why these ideas matter to you and your community. Create quote cards featuring key principles, write short explainer threads on governance concepts, or share implementation success stories from organizations that are already using our tools.

As you become more comfortable with the material, consider developing content series that dive deeper into specific topics. You could explain the five pillars of reform from the Treaty for Our Only Home, create video explainers for particular frameworks, or write case studies showing how global principles apply to local challenges. Interview community leaders about governance challenges they face and how our frameworks might help address them.

**Visual and multimedia content** can make complex ideas more accessible and shareable. Design infographics explaining implementation phases, create visual frameworks for governance principles, or develop process diagrams for decision-making models. If you have video skills, consider producing animated explainers for complex concepts, recording presentation walkthroughs of framework overviews, or creating community testimonials and success stories.

Remember that large files like videos or high-resolution graphics should be hosted on external platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or your personal blog, with links shared in our community channels rather than uploaded directly to our repositories.

### Community building and engagement

Building a thriving community around these ideas requires both online and offline engagement that brings people together for meaningful discussions and collaborative action.

**Local community development** starts with organizing discussion groups where people can explore framework documents together. Host reading clubs, facilitate workshops on governance challenges, or create study groups focused on implementation strategies. Consider organizing community forums where local applications of global principles can be discussed and developed.

Educational outreach expands this work into formal and informal learning environments. Present at universities and academic institutions, speak at community organizations and NGOs, participate in civic engagement events, and contribute to policy discussions and forums. Each of these venues offers opportunities to introduce new audiences to our work while learning from their experiences and perspectives.

**Online community engagement** complements local efforts by connecting you with advocates worldwide. Join our Discord discussions and working groups, contribute to GitHub discussions and documentation, and participate in virtual events and webinars. Share insights in relevant online communities beyond our own platforms, including appropriate subreddits, academic and policy forums, and governance-focused social media groups.

### Stakeholder engagement

Some of the most impactful outreach happens when you connect our frameworks directly with organizations and leaders who could implement them in their work.

**Government officials and policymakers** often appreciate concrete tools they can use immediately. Share implementation guides for public sector adoption, provide policy briefings on framework applications, and connect governance principles to current policy challenges. Offer consultation on system interoperability rather than trying to sell a complete solution.

**Civil society and advocacy organizations** may find our frameworks useful for their campaign goals and internal operations. Demonstrate framework applications for their specific missions, share tools for organizational decision-making, and connect governance principles to social justice work. Provide resources for coalition building that can help them work more effectively with other organizations.

**Academic and research institutions** represent opportunities for deeper engagement and validation of our approaches. Share research opportunities and collaboration ideas, provide frameworks for governance studies, connect with interdisciplinary research programs, and offer case studies for academic analysis.

**Cities and regional governments** often serve as laboratories for innovation in governance. Present local implementation strategies, share tools for community engagement, provide frameworks for regional cooperation, and demonstrate subsidiarity principles in practice.

When engaging with stakeholders, research their current challenges and goals before making contact. Connect framework benefits to their specific needs, offer concrete tools and resources, and propose collaboration rather than simple adoption of our ideas.

### Framework-specific outreach opportunities

As our ecosystem of frameworks continues to mature, exciting opportunities emerge for specialized outreach that goes beyond our foundational documents like the Treaty for Our Only Home.

**Emerging frameworks** in areas like aging, mental health, education, and technology governance each represent unique outreach opportunities. As these frameworks develop, they'll need advocates who understand both the specific domain and our general approach to governance interoperability. Consider becoming a specialist advocate for frameworks that align with your professional expertise or personal interests.

**Collaborative development** of outreach materials works best when domain experts partner with communication specialists. If you're working in healthcare, for example, you might collaborate with our design team to create materials explaining the mental health framework to medical professionals. If you're in education, you could work with video creators to develop content that shows teachers how governance principles apply to classroom and school management.

**Cross-framework connections** become more important as our ecosystem grows. Help audiences understand how different frameworks complement each other and how organizations might implement multiple frameworks simultaneously. Create content that shows the connections between, say, educational governance and technology governance, or how aging frameworks interact with healthcare and community development approaches.

**Pilot program documentation** offers powerful outreach opportunities as frameworks move from theory to practice. If you're involved with an organization implementing one of our frameworks, document the process, challenges, and outcomes. These real-world stories become invaluable for convincing other organizations to try similar approaches.

To get involved in framework-specific outreach, connect with framework contributors through our Discord channels or GitHub discussions. Many framework developers welcome collaboration with communication specialists who can help translate their technical work into accessible outreach materials.

## üõ† Resources and assets

We've developed several resources to support your outreach efforts, with more in development as our community grows.

The **Global Stewardship Advocacy Kit** provides talking points for different audiences, media templates for presentations, social media graphics and templates, and quick reference guides and fact sheets. This comprehensive package gives you professionally designed materials that maintain consistency with our brand and messaging.

Our **Treaty at a Glance Reference Card** offers a one-page summary of key pillars and reforms in a downloadable PDF format that's perfect for sharing at events or sending to busy stakeholders who need quick overviews.

The **Community Asset Pack**, currently in development, will include official logos and brand guidelines, presentation templates and slide decks, color palettes and design specifications, and professional materials for external use. This will enable you to create materials that look professionally designed while maintaining visual consistency across our community.

For content development, we provide style guides for consistent messaging, template formats for different content types, key terminology and concept definitions, and audience-specific communication strategies. We also offer brand guidelines and visual identity resources, template designs for graphics and presentations, and recommendations for tools and software.

## üìù Quality and consistency

Effective outreach requires maintaining quality and consistency across all community-generated content while allowing for creativity and personalization.

**Accuracy and consistency** form the foundation of trustworthy outreach. Ensure all content reflects current framework versions, use consistent terminology and messaging, fact-check all claims and references, and maintain alignment with core principles. When in doubt, ask for clarification in our Discord channels rather than guessing.

**Accessibility and inclusion** help ensure our message reaches diverse audiences effectively. Write in clear, jargon-free language, provide multiple formats when possible, consider diverse cultural perspectives, and ensure content is accessible to people with different abilities.

**Professional presentation** builds credibility and trust with stakeholders. Follow brand guidelines for visual materials, use proper attribution and citations, maintain high production values, and test content with target audiences before wide distribution.

Before sharing content, review it against our quality standards and consider getting feedback from community members who understand both the content and your target audience.

## ü§ù Community coordination

Effective outreach happens through coordination and collaboration rather than isolated individual efforts.

**Community channels** provide spaces for real-time coordination and support. Join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/Zx4hMJf4JU to access dedicated channels for community outreach coordination, content sharing and feedback, and collaborative project development. For formal partnerships, media inquiries, and strategic planning, email us at globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com.

**Working groups and specialization** allow community members to focus their efforts where they can have the most impact. Content creation teams focus on social media strategy, video and multimedia production, writing and documentation, and design and visual communications. Outreach specialization groups work on academic and research engagement, government and policy outreach, civil society connections, and business and technology sector engagement. Regional coordination teams handle local community building, cultural adaptation of messaging, translation and localization, and regional event organization.

**Collaboration opportunities** multiply the impact of individual efforts. Partner with other advocates to create more comprehensive content, share resources and expertise across projects, coordinate outreach to avoid duplication of efforts, and amplify each other's work through cross-promotion.

## üìä Measuring impact

Understanding the effectiveness of outreach efforts helps improve strategies and demonstrates the value of community contributions.

**Content reach and engagement** can be measured through social media shares and interactions, website traffic from shared content, email subscriptions and downloads, and community growth and participation. While not every advocate needs to track detailed metrics, sharing general insights about what works helps the whole community improve.

**Relationship building** impact includes new organizational partnerships, speaking opportunities and invitations, media coverage and mentions, and policy discussions that reference our work. These qualitative outcomes often prove more valuable than quantitative metrics in building long-term movement success.

**Implementation adoption** represents the ultimate goal of outreach efforts. Track organizations using frameworks, local pilot programs and initiatives, academic research and studies incorporating our approaches, and policy proposals that reference our principles.

Document your outreach activities when possible, track engagement metrics where available, share success stories and lessons learned with the community, and participate in periodic impact surveys to help us understand collective progress.

## üéâ Recognition and ongoing support

The Global Governance Frameworks community celebrates contributions and provides ongoing support for advocates at all levels of engagement.

**Community celebration** includes featuring outstanding content on our website and social media, community spotlights and interviews with effective advocates, speaking opportunities at events, and collaboration opportunities with the core team. We believe in recognizing the volunteer efforts that make our work possible.

**Professional development** support includes letters of recommendation for volunteers, references for employment and education opportunities, skills development and training programs, and professional networking connections that can benefit advocates' careers and personal growth.

**Ongoing support** ensures advocates have what they need to be effective over time. We provide regular workshops on outreach strategies, access to new tools and resources as they're developed, peer mentoring and collaboration opportunities, and feedback and guidance from experienced advocates.

Community building activities include regular virtual meetups and events, annual contributor recognition ceremonies, professional development opportunities, and access to exclusive content and previews of new framework developments.

## üöÄ Your journey as an advocate

Every effective advocate starts with a single step, builds skills and relationships over time, and eventually helps others begin their own advocacy journeys.

**Getting started** means joining our Discord community to connect with other advocates, reviewing existing frameworks to understand the content you'll be sharing, choosing a focus area that matches your skills and interests, downloading relevant resources for your chosen activities, starting with manageable projects like a social media post or local conversation, and sharing your work to get feedback and encouragement from the community.

**Building your practice** involves developing regular outreach activities that fit your schedule and energy, building relationships with key stakeholders in your areas of interest, creating original content and resources that reflect your unique perspective, and eventually mentoring new community advocates who are just getting started.

**Growing your impact** happens as you take on leadership roles in working groups or regional coordination, contribute to outreach strategy and planning discussions, develop new resources and tools that benefit the whole community, and help expand our collective reach through your networks and relationships.

Remember that effective outreach is a marathon, not a sprint. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can. Every conversation matters, every piece of content has the potential to reach the right person at the right time, and every relationship you build contributes to the larger project of creating more cooperative, effective governance systems.

The future depends on our ability to work together across difference and distance. Your outreach efforts are a crucial part of building that future. Thank you for joining us in this important work.
