# Global Governance Frameworks - Translator's Kit

Welcome to the Global Governance Frameworks Translation Program! This guide will help you contribute to making these critical governance frameworks accessible in your language.

## üåç Why Translation Matters

The Global Governance Frameworks addresses humanity's most pressing challenges - from climate change to digital governance to peace-building. By translating these frameworks, you're helping communities worldwide access tools for positive change in their native language.

## üìã Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Review this entire guide
- [ ] Set up GitHub access
- [ ] Choose your framework(s) to translate
- [ ] Join the translation community
- [ ] Download necessary tools

## üîß Technical Setup

### 1. GitHub Repository Access

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFramework/governance-framework-site

#### Install Git (Choose your operating system)

**Windows:**
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Open "Git Bash" from the Start menu

**macOS:**
```bash
# Option 1: Install via Homebrew (recommended)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git

# Option 2: Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

**Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora):**
```bash
# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git
```

#### Set Up Git
```bash
# Configure your identity (required for commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

#### Fork and Clone the Repository

**Step 1: Fork on GitHub**
1. Go to https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFramework/governance-framework-site
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner

# Navigate into the project
cd governance-framework-site

# Add the original repository as upstream (for getting updates)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFramework/governance-framework-site.git
```

**Step 3: Create Your Translation Branch**
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for your translation
git checkout -b translate-[framework-name]-[language-code]

# Example: 
git checkout -b translate-peace-es
```

### 2. Understanding the File Structure

The frameworks are organized as follows:

```
/src/lib/content/frameworks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en/               # English (source language)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sv/               # Swedish 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es/               # Spanish
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fr/               # French
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your-language]/  # Your target language
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ peace/           # Peace & Conflict Resolution
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mental-health/   # Mental Health
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ education/       # Education
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technology/      # Technology
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other-frameworks]/
```

## üìù What to Translate

### Priority 1: Framework Content Files

**Location:** `/src/lib/content/frameworks/[language]/implementation/[framework-name]/`

**File Types:**
- `*.md` files - Main framework content (Markdown format)
- Individual section files (e.g., `core-principles.md`, `implementation-timeline.md`)

**Example Framework Folders:**
- `peace/` - Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework
- `mental-health/` - Mental Health Framework  
- `education/` - Education Framework
- `technology/` - Technology Governance Framework
- `environmental-stewardship/` - Environmental Stewardship Framework

### Priority 2: User Interface Text

**Location:** `/src/lib/i18n/[language-code].json`

**Contains:**
- Navigation menus
- Button labels
- Form text
- General website interface elements

### Priority 3: Visual Assets

**Location:** `/static/images/frameworks/`

**File Naming Convention:**
- `framework-diagram-en.svg` (English)
- `framework-diagram-sv.svg` (Swedish)
- `framework-diagram-[your-language-code].svg` (Your language)

*Note: SVG editing requires graphic design tools like Inkscape (free) or Adobe Illustrator*

## üó£Ô∏è Language Codes

Use standard ISO 639-1 codes:

| Language | Code | Example Folder |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Spanish | es | `/frameworks/es/` |
| French | fr | `/frameworks/fr/` |
| German | de | `/frameworks/de/` |
| Portuguese | pt | `/frameworks/pt/` |

| Russian | ru | `/frameworks/ru/` |

## üìñ Translation Guidelines

### 1. Key Principles

**Accuracy First:** Maintain the precise meaning of technical and policy concepts
**Cultural Adaptation:** Adapt examples and references to your local context when appropriate
**Consistency:** Use the same translation for recurring terms throughout
**Accessibility:** Write in clear, accessible language for your target audience

### 2. Tone and Style

- **Formal but accessible** - These are serious policy documents that should be understandable
- **Active voice preferred** - "Governments should implement..." not "Implementation should be done by governments..."
- **Gender-neutral language** - Use inclusive language appropriate to your language's conventions
- **Professional terminology** - Maintain technical accuracy while ensuring readability

### 3. Handling Technical Terms

**Do NOT translate:**
- Proper nouns (United Nations, IPCC, etc.)
- Established technical acronyms (AI, GDP, CO2, etc.)
- Framework names (keep "Global Governance Frameworks")

**DO translate but maintain consistency:**
- Policy concepts (governance, sustainability, resilience)
- Implementation terms (assessment, monitoring, evaluation)
- Social concepts (community engagement, stakeholder participation)

## üîë Key Terms Glossary

| English Term | Definition | Translation Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Polycrisis** | Multiple, interconnected crises occurring simultaneously | New term - may need explanation in your language |
| **Ecocide Law** | Legal framework criminalizing severe environmental destruction | Legal term - research equivalent in your jurisdiction |
| **Digital Governance** | Frameworks for governing digital technologies and spaces | Emerging field - may need contextual explanation |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Process of involving affected parties in decision-making | Common in policy - find established equivalent |
| **Implementation Timeline** | Scheduled phases for putting framework into practice | Standard project management term |
| **Cross-Domain Integration** | Coordination across different policy areas | Technical term - maintain precision |
| **Trauma-Informed Approaches** | Methods that recognize and respond to trauma impacts | Clinical/social term - use established translation |
| **Value Systems** | Core beliefs and principles guiding behavior | Philosophical concept - cultural adaptation may be needed |
