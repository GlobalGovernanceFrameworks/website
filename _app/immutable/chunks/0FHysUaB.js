By intentionally creating space for multiple value systems—from traditional/tribal (Purple), to authority-based (Blue), to achievement-oriented (Orange), to egalitarian (Green)—the Commission developed innovative governance mechanisms that could speak to all South Africans. Under Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu’s leadership, the process exemplified second-tier (Yellow) consciousness by integrating traditional reconciliation rituals, formal legal procedures, economic development considerations, and communal healing practices. This developmentally-informed approach helped South Africa navigate a critical transition that might have collapsed if addressed through a single value system lens. The case demonstrates how understanding developmental stages enables more effective, inclusive peace governance that meets people where they are while supporting evolution toward more complex consciousness.</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong>: For a deeper understanding of Spiral Dynamics and its applications to peace and governance, visit <a href="https://www.spiralize.org" rel="nofollow">Spiralize.org</a> — a platform offering interactive tools and resources for applying developmental frameworks to complex global challenges.</p>',1);function m(e){var n=s();o(18),i(e,n)}export{m as default,a as metadata};
