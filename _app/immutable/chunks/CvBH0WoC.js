Introduction üìã</h1> <h2>1.1 Purpose üéØ</h2> <p>The Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience (DRR&R) Implementation Framework is a proof-of-concept initiative designed to strengthen disaster resilience within multi-level governance systems. Developed as part of the Global Governance Framework (globalgovernanceframework.org), this framework emerges from a vision to foster ethical, compassionate, and interconnected systems that support human and non-human life in the face of escalating disaster risks. As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of hazards worldwide, the need for coordinated, equitable approaches to disaster governance has never been more urgent. This framework aims to bridge fragmented efforts and catalyze transformative action across diverse contexts.</p> <h2>1.2 Alignment with Global Priorities üåç</h2> <p>The framework aligns with and builds upon established global priorities, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate adaptation frameworks. It integrates lessons from historical disasters, Indigenous and local knowledge systems, and cutting-edge innovations to address the complex interplay of hazards, vulnerabilities, and systemic inequities. By drawing from these diverse knowledge sources, the framework seeks to avoid reinventing existing approaches while filling critical gaps in implementation.</p> <h2>1.3 Scope and Structure üî¨</h2> <p>The scope of this framework is deliberately broad yet adaptable, offering a modular structure that can be tailored to local, regional, and global contexts. It encompasses the full disaster management cycle‚Äîrisk assessment, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery‚Äîwhile embedding cross-sectoral co-benefits, such as leveraging disaster infrastructure for public health and education. The framework prioritizes equity, inclusivity, and cultural sensitivity, seeking to empower marginalized voices‚Äîincluding those from the Global South, women, youth, persons with disabilities, and Indigenous communities‚Äîwhile ensuring mental health, ecosystem health, and just transitions are central to resilience-building efforts.</p> <h2>1.4 Development Status and Invitation for Collaboration ü§ù</h2> <p>This framework is not a finalized solution but a living proposal in ongoing development. Different sections range from conceptual to partially operational, reflecting the evolving nature of disaster governance. As a collaborative draft, it invites stakeholders‚Äîincluding communities, governments, NGOs, the private sector, and policymakers‚Äîto explore, critique, and refine its components. Through implementation, we anticipate communities will experience reduced disaster impacts, more inclusive decision-making processes, and enhanced capacity to adapt to changing conditions. The subsequent sections provide practical guidance on principles, components, implementation approaches, and evaluation mechanisms that can be adapted to diverse contexts.</p> <p>We invite the globalgovernanceframework.org community and beyond to join us in co-creating a resilient future where all life thrives in harmony, even in the face of increasing disaster risks. Your insights, critiques, and innovations are essential to shaping this framework‚Äôs evolution and real-world impact.</p>",1);function p(e){var i=s();a(18),n(e,i)}export{p as default,o as metadata};
