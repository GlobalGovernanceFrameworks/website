These objectives, aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Agreement, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), provide clear, measurable targets for stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, policymakers, and private sectors. By integrating regenerative agriculture, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and cutting-edge technology, these goals drive systemic change toward a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future.</p> <h2><a id="enhance-food-security"></a>Enhance Food Security</h2> <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Increase access to nutritious, affordable, and culturally appropriate food globally, reducing hunger and supporting local food systems.</p> <p><strong>Targets</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Reduce global hunger by 50% by 2030, aligning with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).</li> <li>Decrease import dependency by 20% in vulnerable regions by 2030 through strengthened local food systems.</li></ul> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Expand community-led food hubs to improve distribution in underserved areas.</li> <li>Support urban agriculture and smallholder cooperatives to boost local production.</li> <li>Implement nutrition-focused programs to ensure dietary diversity.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Make sure everyone has enough healthy, local food to eat, cutting hunger in half by 2030.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 2 and the United Nations (UN) Right to Food.</p> <h2><a id="promote-sustainable-practices"></a>Promote Sustainable Practices</h2> <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Scale agroecological and regenerative methods to restore ecosystems, preserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change.</p> <p><strong>Targets</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Achieve 30% of global farmland under regenerative practices by 2035 (2025: 5%, 2029: 15%).</li> <li>Reduce irrigation waste by 25% through water conservation techniques by 2030.</li> <li>Support 10,000 community-led water management projects (e.g., rainwater harvesting, watershed restoration) by 2030.</li> <li>Preserve genetic diversity by supporting 1,000 crop varieties and seed banks by 2030.</li></ul> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Incentivize soil health through carbon sequestration programs.</li> <li>Establish seed banks with indigenous communities to preserve crop diversity.</li> <li>Promote agroforestry and no-till farming to enhance biodiversity.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Grow food in ways that help nature, save water, and protect different types of crops for the future.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 15 (Life on Land), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).</p> <h2><a id="foster-innovation"></a>Foster Innovation</h2> <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Integrate climate-smart technologies and TEK to enhance productivity, accessibility, and sustainability while bridging digital divides.</p> <p><strong>Targets</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Launch 100 artificial intelligence (AI)-driven projects for crop modeling and supply chain optimization by 2030, with data privacy protocols.</li> <li>Track 25% of global agricultural trade using blockchain by 2035, with safeguards against data monopolies.</li> <li>Reach 1 million farmers in low-connectivity areas with low-tech solutions (e.g., Short Message Service [SMS] alerts, radio training) by 2030.</li> <li>Establish 500 community-owned peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms and train 1 million farmers via open-source knowledge platforms by 2030.</li></ul> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Deploy precision agriculture and vertical farming for smallholders.</li> <li>Balance high-tech (e.g., AI, blockchain) with low-tech (e.g., SMS alerts) solutions.</li> <li>Develop hybrid models combining low-cost sensors with agroecological practices.</li> <li>Support open-source seed libraries and TEK repositories.</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Examples</strong>:</p> <ul><li><em>Kenya</em>: iCow’s SMS alerts, integrated with TEK, boosted yields by 20% for smallholder farmers.</li> <li><em>India</em>: Digital Green’s video-based TEK training reached 1.5 million farmers, enhancing sustainable practices.</li> <li><em>Peru</em>: The Potato Park preserved 1,200 potato varieties using TEK, strengthening food security.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Use new technology and traditional knowledge to help farmers grow more food sustainably, even in remote areas.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 13 and the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines.</p> <h2><a id="ensure-equitable-trade"></a>Ensure Equitable Trade</h2> <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Reform trade policies to protect local markets, ensure fair pricing, and promote equitable access to global markets.</p> <p><strong>Targets</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Reduce trade barriers for small-scale producers by 15% by 2030.</li> <li>Achieve fair trade certification for 50% of global agricultural exports by 2035.</li></ul> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Advocate for policy reforms to prioritize smallholder market access.</li> <li>Expand fair trade networks to support equitable pricing.</li> <li>Develop regional trade buffers to mitigate geopolitical disruptions.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Make trade fairer so small farmers get better prices and access to markets.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 2 and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).</p> <h2><a id="link-to-regional-customization"></a>Link to Regional Customization</h2> <p>The objectives are tailored to regional needs, ensuring relevance across diverse contexts:</p> <ul><li>Sub-Saharan Africa: Focus on drought-resistant crops and SMS-based knowledge systems.</li> <li>South Asia: Emphasize urban agriculture and micro-irrigation.</li> <li>Latin America: Prioritize agroforestry and indigenous seed banks.</li> <li>Island Nations: Develop saltwater-tolerant crops and aquaponics.</li> <li>Conflict Zones: Support mobile seed banks and community gardens.</li></ul> <p>Detailed strategies are outlined in <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#10-regional-customization">Regional Customization</a>.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Adjust goals to fit local needs, like drought-proof crops in Africa or urban farms in Asia.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: These objectives drive the framework’s <a
