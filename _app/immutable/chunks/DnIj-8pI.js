Current aging policies are typically developed by younger politicians and bureaucrats with minimal elder input, creating systems that serve institutional needs rather than elder priorities. Nested governance creates interconnected decision-making systems where elders control aging policy at every level while enabling coordination and resource sharing across communities, regions, and nations.</p> <h2><a id="local-implementation-elder-agency"></a>Local Implementation and Elder Agency</h2> <h3>1.1 Community-Led Elder Cooperatives</h3> <p><strong>Elder-Controlled Local Governance</strong>: Democratic decision-making structures where elders design, implement, and evaluate their own support systems:</p> <p><strong>Cooperative Structure and Formation</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Democratic governance</strong>: One elder, one vote decision-making for all aging-related policies and resource allocation affecting the community</li> <li><strong>Inclusive membership</strong>: All community elders invited to participate regardless of economic status, health condition, or family situation</li> <li><strong>Cultural adaptation</strong>: Cooperative structures modified to respect diverse cultural approaches to elder leadership and community decision-making</li> <li><strong>Accessibility integration</strong>: Participation methods accommodating diverse cognitive, physical, and communication abilities</li></ul> <p><strong>Policy Development Authority</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>AUBI implementation</strong>: Local elder cooperatives controlling how AUBI is distributed, what contributions are recognized, and how needs are assessed</li> <li><strong>Care service design</strong>: Elder-led development of community care approaches, service delivery methods, and quality standards</li> <li><strong>Housing and community development</strong>: Elder participation in neighborhood planning, accessibility improvements, and age-friendly infrastructure development</li> <li><strong>Innovation priorities</strong>: Community elder leadership in identifying problems, supporting innovation, and directing local aging-related research and development</li></ul> <p><strong>Resource Control and Management</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Budget participation</strong>: Elder cooperatives controlling significant portions of local aging-related budgets with transparent decision-making processes</li> <li><strong>Service provider selection</strong>: Elder communities choosing and evaluating organizations providing aging-related services</li> <li><strong>Community asset management</strong>: Elder participation in managing community centers, housing cooperatives, and shared resources</li> <li><strong>Economic development</strong>: Elder leadership in local economic development affecting aging populations</li></ul> <p><strong>Example (Fictive)</strong>: The Malmö Elder Cooperative, representing 2,400 elders across six neighborhoods, operates with monthly assemblies where elders vote on AUBI contribution recognition criteria, select healthcare providers, and allocate community development funds.
