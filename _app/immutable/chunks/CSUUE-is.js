It summarizes the framework’s key ideas and provides simple steps to start making a difference in your community. The guide aligns with the Global Goals (SDGs) and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), encouraging you to join the movement for sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems by 2035. It is part of the <a href="/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip">Seed Starter Kit</a> and complements the framework’s <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#01-introduction">Introduction</a>.</p> <h2>What is the framework?</h2> <p>The <em>Food and Agriculture Framework</em> is a plan to improve food systems—how we grow, share, and eat food—for people and the planet. It focuses on:</p> <ul><li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: Growing food in ways that benefit the environment, such as regenerative agriculture.</li> <li><strong>Equity</strong>: Ensuring everyone, especially Indigenous peoples, women, and youth, shares in the benefits.</li> <li><strong>Resilience</strong>: Building food systems that can withstand challenges like climate change or conflicts.</li></ul> <p><strong>Major goals by 2035:</strong></p> <ul><li>Halve global hunger.</li> <li>Make 30% of agricultural land regenerative (eco-friendly).</li> <li>Train 5 million farmers, including in Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).</li></ul> <p><em>Plain-language explanation</em>: This is a plan to grow food in a way that’s good for the Earth, fair for everyone, and ready for tough times—with goals like reducing hunger and greening agriculture.</p> <p><strong>Aligned with</strong>: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).</p> <h2>Why it matters</h2> <p>Food affects everything—our health, environment, culture, and economy. But today’s food systems often harm nature, deepen inequalities, and leave many hungry. We can change this.</p> <p><em>Plain-language explanation</em>: Food is more than nutrition—it’s about how we treat each other and the planet.</p> <h2>Key actions to get started</h2> <p>Want to contribute? Here are some simple steps:</p> <ol><li>🌱 <strong>Launch a pilot project</strong> – Use the Seed Starter Kit to test regenerative methods in your area.</li> <li>🤝 <strong>Collaborate with others</strong> – Build networks with farmers, youth groups, or Indigenous communities.</li> <li>🗣️ <strong>Share knowledge</strong> – Use radio, SMS, apps, or meetings to spread solutions.</li> <li>📣 <strong>Advocate to policymakers</strong> – Help change policies and rules to support fair and sustainable solutions.</li> <li>📊 <strong>Track progress</strong> – Use simple tools to measure what works and adapt as needed.</li></ol> <p><em>Plain-language explanation</em>: You can make a difference—alone or with others. Start where you are.</p> <h2>Tools to help you</h2> <ul><li><strong>Seed Starter Kit</strong> – Everything you need to launch a local project: <a href="#">Download here</a></li> <li><strong>Training guides</strong> – For regenerative agriculture and TEK</li> <li><strong>Partnership template</strong> – For building local collaborations</li> <li><strong>Monitoring & evaluation tools</strong> – Simple templates to track progress</li></ul> <p><em>Plain-language explanation</em>: We have ready-to-use tools you can apply right away.</p> <h2>Get involved</h2> <ul><li>🌍 Join a global network of communities building tomorrow’s food systems.</li> <li>🧑🏽‍🌾 Share your story, photos, or results.</li> <li>🔄 Help translate or distribute the guide to more languages and groups.</li> <li>💬 Give us feedback—your voice shapes the next version.</li></ul> <p><strong>Together, we can create a food system that’s sustainable, fair, and resilient—for everyone.</strong></p>',1);function p(e){var o=n();i(46),a(e,o)}export{p as default,r as metadata};
