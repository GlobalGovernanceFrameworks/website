Human & Non-Human Rights Commitments</h1> <p>The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework expands traditional human rights approaches to encompass a broader spectrum of beings while maintaining robust protections for humans. This section outlines specific rights commitments across categories, establishing clear standards for implementation and enforcement.</p> <p>Our approach recognizes that rights exist on a continuum, with different types of beings requiring different forms of recognition and protection. However, all rights ultimately derive from the same foundational values: dignity, autonomy, protection from harm, and the ability to flourish according to oneâ€™s nature.</p> <p>The framework establishes a hierarchy during conflicts, prioritizing survival rights over autonomy rights in crisis situations, while seeking balanced solutions that respect all beings whenever possible. Where rights conflicts arise, we employ structured conflict resolution protocols (detailed in section 3.3) to ensure fair and consistent outcomes.</p>",1);function p(t){var e=a();n(6),o(t,e)}export{p as default,s as metadata};
