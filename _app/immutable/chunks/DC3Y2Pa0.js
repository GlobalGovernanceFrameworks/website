<p><strong>Format</strong>: Facilitation guide, ceremony templates, dialogue scripts, case studies</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: The “Amazonas Region” pilot united indigenous shamans and Christian leaders to restore 10,000 hectares of forest through interfaith dialogues. Using the <em>Dialogue Facilitation Guide</em> and cultural consent protocols, they integrated traditional ecological knowledge with scientific approaches, creating a governance model that recognized the forest as a rights-holder. Indigenous-led audits verified cultural consent compliance throughout implementation.</p> <p><strong>Access</strong>: <a href="https://globalgovernanceframework.org/tools/sacred-seed-kit" rel="nofollow">globalgovernanceframework.org/tools/sacred-seed-kit</a></p> <h4>TGIF’s Governance System Mapper</h4> <p><strong>Format</strong>: Interactive digital tool, printable templates, implementation guide</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: In a Bristol, UK pilot (2019-2022), the Governance System Mapper was used to visualize relationships between local government, community organizations, and businesses in a community currency initiative.
