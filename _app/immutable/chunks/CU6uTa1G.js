It’s for us—young people—to lead change in our communities. Start by understanding your rights, then gather your peers, and make your voice heard in the design of these programs. Remember, nothing about us without us!”</em></p></blockquote> <h2>Know Your Rights</h2> <p>Youth have specific rights within justice systems that must be protected and upheld. These include:</p> <ul><li><strong>Right to be heard</strong>: Your voice matters in all decisions affecting you</li> <li><strong>Right to fair treatment</strong>: Free from discrimination based on race, gender, economic status, or other factors</li> <li><strong>Right to legal assistance</strong>: Access to attorneys and support, explained in language you understand</li> <li><strong>Right to safety</strong>: Protection from harm, intimidation, and re-traumatization</li> <li><strong>Right to rehabilitation</strong>: Focus on recovery and reintegration, not punishment</li> <li><strong>Right to privacy</strong>: Confidentiality of your case and personal information</li> <li><strong>Right to education</strong>: Continued learning opportunities throughout justice processes</li> <li><strong>Right to cultural connection</strong>: Respect for your cultural identity and practices</li></ul> <p>These rights are protected under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights frameworks. If your rights are violated, you can report this through the complaint mechanisms outlined in this guide.</p> <h2>Youth Justice Principles</h2> <p>The following principles guide youth justice reforms, ensuring alignment with equity, rehabilitation, and cultural sensitivity:</p> <ul><li><strong>Rehabilitation Focus</strong>: Prioritize rehabilitation over punishment, targeting 80% of youth cases using restorative practices by Year 4 (2029).</li> <li><strong>Equity and Inclusion</strong>: Ensure fair access for marginalized youth, targeting ≥50% representation in program design by Year 3 (2028).</li> <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: Respect indigenous and local traditions, integrating culturally appropriate practices with youth and elder consent.</li> <li><strong>Youth Empowerment</strong>: Involve youth in decision-making, targeting 50% youth-led initiatives by Year 3.</li> <li><strong>Human Rights Compliance</strong>: Align with global standards (e.g., UN Convention on the Rights of the Child), targeting 100% compliance by Year 4 (2029).</li> <li><strong>Community-Centered</strong>: Engage families and communities to support rehabilitation, targeting 70% community involvement by Year 3.</li> <li><strong>Evidence-Based</strong>: Ground reforms in data from the <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf">Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template</a>.</li> <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Provide services in multiple formats (e.g., digital, in-person) and languages, targeting 80% coverage by Year 4.</li></ul> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/justice/stakeholder-roles-chart.svg" alt="Stakeholder Roles Chart"></p> <h2>Youth Justice Strategies</h2> <p>Follow these strategies to implement youth justice reforms, customizable to local contexts.</p> <h3>Strategy 1: Conduct Youth Justice Gap Analysis</h3> <ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Identify gaps in current youth justice systems.</li> <li><strong>Actions</strong>: <ul><li>Use the Youth Justice Gap Analysis Template (below) to assess access, equity, and rehabilitation metrics.</li> <li>Collect data on youth case outcomes, recidivism rates, and marginalized group representation, referencing <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf">Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template</a>.</li> <li>Engage youth, families, and indigenous leaders in focus groups, targeting 50% marginalized group input by Year 2 (2027).</li> <li>Identify resource needs (e.g., mediators, digital tools) using the <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.pdf">Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool</a>.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Gap analysis report, submitted to Regional Justice Hubs.</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: 2–3 months.</li></ul> <blockquote><p><strong>YOUTH VOICE</strong>: <em>“Don’t just collect data about us—collect data with us. We know what’s happening in our communities and what barriers we face. Train young people as co-researchers to help gather more honest feedback from other youth.”</em></p></blockquote> <h3>Strategy 2: Develop Restorative Youth Justice Programs</h3> <ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Implement restorative practices for youth rehabilitation.</li> <li><strong>Actions</strong>: <ul><li>Design programs (e.g., victim-offender mediation, peer circles) using the <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/restorative-justice-guide-en.pdf">Restorative Justice Guide</a>, targeting 80% of eligible cases by Year 4 (2029).</li> <li>Train mediators and youth facilitators, targeting 100 trained per jurisdiction by Year 3 (2028).</li> <li>Integrate indigenous practices (e.g., elder-led dialogues), per <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/indigenous-justice-integration-template-en.pdf">Indigenous Justice Integration Template</a>, with elder approval.</li> <li>Pilot programs in priority areas, targeting 200 youth cases resolved by Year 3.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Program design and training materials.</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: 6–12 months.</li></ul> <blockquote><p><strong>Creative Expression Component</strong>: Consider incorporating arts-based approaches—music, poetry, visual arts, or theater—into restorative programs. These creative outlets can help youth process emotions, build skills, and share their stories in ways that traditional dialogue alone might not achieve. Collaborate with local artists and cultural practitioners to develop programs that resonate with youth experiences.</p></blockquote> <h3>Strategy 3: Enhance Access for Marginalized Youth</h3> <ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Ensure equitable access to justice services.</li> <li><strong>Actions</strong>: <ul><li>Expand legal aid and counseling for marginalized youth, targeting 80% coverage by Year 4 (2029).</li> <li>Provide multilingual and culturally sensitive services, targeting 70% local language use by Year 3 (2028).</li> <li>Use digital platforms (e.g., mobile apps for legal support) to reach remote youth, per <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice#05-digital-justice-innovation">Digital Justice & Innovation</a>, targeting 70% digital access by Year 5 (2030).</li> <li>Partner with youth organizations to deliver services, targeting 50 partnerships by Year 3.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Access plan and partnership agreements.</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: 6–12 months.</li></ul> <h3>Strategy 4: Empower Youth in Decision-Making</h3> <ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Involve youth in shaping justice reforms.</li> <li><strong>Actions</strong>: <ul><li>Establish youth advisory councils, targeting 50% marginalized youth representation by Year 3 (2028).</li> <li>Train youth as advocates and mediators, targeting 100 trained per jurisdiction by Year 3, using <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/advocacy-playbook-en.pdf">Advocacy Playbook</a>.</li> <li>Host youth-led forums to gather input, targeting 100 events by Year 3.</li> <li>Integrate youth feedback into program design, targeting 60% of policies reflecting youth input by Year 4 (2029).</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Advisory council charter and youth training materials.</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: 3–6 months.</li></ul> <h3>Strategy 5: Build Community and Family Support</h3> <ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Strengthen community and family involvement in youth justice.</li> <li><strong>Actions</strong>: <ul><li>Engage families in restorative processes, targeting 70% family participation by Year 3 (2028).</li> <li>Partner with community organizations to provide mentorship and rehabilitation support, targeting 50 programs by Year 3.</li> <li>Use culturally appropriate engagement methods (e.g., indigenous ceremonies), with elder consent.</li> <li>Leverage <a href="/frameworks/tools/justice/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.pdf">Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template</a> to formalize partnerships.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Community engagement plan and mentorship programs.</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: 6–12 months.</li></ul> <h3>Strategy 6: Monitor and Evaluate Outcomes</h3> <ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Assess impact and ensure continuous improvement.</li> <li><strong>Actions</strong>: <ul><li>Track metrics (see Monitoring and Evaluation section) using the framework’s metrics dashboard.</li> <li>Conduct biannual reviews with youth and community input, targeting 85% stakeholder satisfaction by Year 4 (2029).</li> <li>Publish outcomes in accessible formats (e.g., youth-friendly infographics), targeting 70% community reach by Year 3.</li> <li>Share best practices via the knowledge management system (<a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice#04-implementation-mechanisms">Implementation Mechanisms</a>).</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Evaluation reports and best practice guides.</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: Ongoing, with biannual reporting.</li></ul> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/justice/feedback-loop-diagram.svg" alt="Youth Justice Feedback Loop"></p> <h2>Success Story: Tasha’s Journey</h2> <blockquote><p>When 16-year-old Tasha was caught shoplifting electronics from a local store, her case could have followed the traditional path through juvenile court. Instead, her community had implemented the Youth Justice Guide’s restorative approaches.</p> <p>Tasha was referred to a peer-led mediation circle where she met with the store owner in a safe, supportive environment. Rather than focusing on punishment, the circle explored the impacts of her actions and underlying factors—Tasha revealed she was trying to resell the items to help her family with rent after her mother lost her job.</p> <p>The circle’s youth facilitator, who had been trained through the local Youth Advisory Council, guided Tasha to make amends by working at the store for two months. The store owner, moved by her situation, offered her a part-time position afterward. Community services helped her family with housing support.</p> <p>Six months later, Tasha joined her community’s Youth Justice Council, where she now helps design programs for other youth. “The circle saw me as a whole person, not just my mistake,” she explains. “Now I help make sure other young people get the same opportunity to be heard and supported.”</p> <p>Tasha’s case represents the framework’s success: rehabilitation over punishment, community involvement, and youth empowerment—resulting in no formal record and a 0% recidivism outcome.</p></blockquote> <h2>Youth Justice Templates</h2> <h3>Template 1: Youth Justice Gap Analysis</h3> <pre class="language-undefined"><!></pre> <p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Complete for each area (e.g., access, rehabilitation).
