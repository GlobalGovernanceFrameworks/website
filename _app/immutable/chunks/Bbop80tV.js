While this framework is Indigenous-led and maintains Indigenous authority at every level, it creates multiple entry points for non-Indigenous people and organizations to support transformation while respecting Indigenous leadership and cultural protocols. These pathways emphasize relationship-building, mutual learning, and long-term commitment rather than extractive engagement or performative allyship.</p> <p>Each pathway operates under the fundamental principle that allies support Indigenous leadership rather than directing or co-opting Indigenous initiatives. Engagement requires ongoing relationship, cultural education, and accountability to Indigenous communities rather than one-time actions or symbolic gestures. The framework provides clear guidance for ethical engagement while maintaining Indigenous authority over the terms and conditions of collaboration.</p> <h2><a id="allied-bioregional-stewards"></a>Allied Bioregional Stewards</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“The land calls to all her children.
