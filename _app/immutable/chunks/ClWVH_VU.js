By tracking multiple dimensions—from climate and biodiversity to equity, rights, and well-being—they ensure a holistic view of implementation impacts. The combination of long-term targets and intermediate milestones facilitates adaptive management, while diverse measurement approaches integrate scientific, indigenous, and community perspectives.</p> <p>The metrics are designed not merely to track compliance but to stimulate learning and improvement throughout implementation. Regular reporting, transparent methodologies, and stakeholder participation in assessment ensure that metrics serve as tools for collective reflection and evolution rather than mere accountability mechanisms. Through this approach, the metrics become an integral part of the transformation process itself, helping to build the regenerative world envisioned by the framework.</p>',1);function h(i){var e=r();s(186),n(i,e)}export{h as default,o as metadata};
