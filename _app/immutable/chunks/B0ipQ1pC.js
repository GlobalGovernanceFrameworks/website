This comprehensive engagement strategy moves beyond consultation to shared power, co-governance, and community control over biodiversity initiatives. All engagement mechanisms prioritize cultural competency, traditional knowledge sovereignty, and the understanding that lasting biodiversity protection emerges from justice, equity, and democratic participation rather than top-down conservation approaches.</p> <h2><a id="indigenous-communities-traditional-authorities"></a>Indigenous Communities and Traditional Authorities</h2> <h3>Sovereignty
