Introduction</h2> <p><strong>In this section:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="#purpose-and-context">Purpose and Context</a></li> <li><a href="#scope-and-vision">Scope and Vision</a></li> <li><a href="#key-definitions-and-principles">Key Definitions and Principles</a></li></ul> <h3><a id="purpose-and-context"></a>Purpose and Context</h3> <p>The climate crisis represents humanity’s most urgent collective challenge, threatening ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide. Despite three decades of international climate negotiations since the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and global temperatures are on track to exceed dangerous thresholds. Meanwhile, global energy systems—responsible for approximately two-thirds of emissions—remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels despite the rapidly falling costs of clean alternatives.</p> <p>This Climate & Energy Governance Framework builds upon and strengthens existing international mechanisms, including the UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, and IPCC assessment processes. Rather than replacing these foundations, this framework addresses critical gaps in implementation, enforcement, equity, and coordination that have hindered effective climate action. It recognizes that climate and energy challenges are fundamentally interconnected and require integrated governance approaches that span global to local scales.</p> <p>The framework responds to mounting evidence that current governance structures are insufficient to deliver the pace and scale of transformation needed. It acknowledges that while the Paris Agreement established important principles and processes, its voluntary nature and limited enforcement mechanisms have not generated adequate ambition or accountability. Similarly, while the IPCC provides essential scientific guidance, translating this knowledge into coordinated policy action remains challenging.</p> <p>By providing a comprehensive governance architecture with clear authority, responsibilities, and mechanisms, this framework aims to accelerate the transition to a climate-safe, equitable energy future while respecting national sovereignty and diverse development pathways.</p> <h3><a id="scope-and-vision"></a>Scope and Vision</h3> <p>This framework addresses the full spectrum of climate and energy governance needs, encompassing:</p> <ul><li><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors</li> <li><strong>Adaptation</strong>: Building resilience to unavoidable climate impacts</li> <li><strong>Energy Systems Transformation</strong>: Transitioning to clean, accessible energy</li> <li><strong>Finance</strong>: Mobilizing and directing capital toward climate solutions</li> <li><strong>Justice</strong>: Ensuring equitable burden-sharing and benefit distribution</li> <li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Accelerating technological and social solutions</li></ul> <p>Our vision is a world that has successfully limited warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels while ensuring energy access for all. In this future, nations have transformed their economies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through just transitions that leave no one behind. Climate-resilient infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and adaptive capacity protect vulnerable communities from unavoidable impacts. Energy systems are predominantly powered by renewable sources, with energy efficiency maximized and universal access achieved.</p> <p>This governance framework enables a world where climate action strengthens rather than constrains human development, where historical inequities are addressed, and where natural systems regenerate rather than degrade. It envisions governance that is democratic, transparent, and accountable, with meaningful participation from all stakeholders, especially those most affected by climate impacts and energy transitions.</p> <h3><a id="key-definitions-and-principles"></a>Key Definitions and Principles</h3> <p>To ensure clarity and shared understanding, this framework defines key terms as follows:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Net-zero emissions</strong>: A state where greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere are balanced by their removal, resulting in no net contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. This requires both deep reductions in emissions and enhancement of carbon sinks.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Climate finance</strong>: Financial resources directed toward climate change mitigation, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage. These include grants, loans, guarantees, and other financial instruments from public, private, and blended sources.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Clean energy</strong>: Energy sources that produce minimal or zero greenhouse gas emissions during operation. These include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear energy. Fossil fuels, even with carbon capture and storage (CCS), are excluded unless independently verified to deliver net-negative emissions outcomes at scale.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Climate justice</strong>: The recognition that climate change affects different populations unequally based on historical responsibility, vulnerability, and capacity, requiring equitable distribution of burdens and benefits in climate action.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Just transition</strong>: A process that ensures the benefits of the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future are shared widely, while also supporting those who may lose livelihoods, ensuring energy access for all, and addressing historical inequities.</p></li></ul> <p>These definitions underpin the framework’s approach to climate and energy governance, providing a common language for diverse stakeholders across national, cultural, and sectoral boundaries.</p>',1);function g(e){var n=o();a(32),t(e,n)}export{g as default,s as metadata};
