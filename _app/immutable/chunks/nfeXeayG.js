As depicted in this spiral visualization, rights protection extends outward from humans to other forms of being, with appropriate protections scaled to capacity for suffering, complexity, and ecological significance. The color coding indicates the nature of protections at each tier, from urgent fundamental rights (red) to provisional protections for emerging entities (orange).”</em></p> <p><img src="/frameworks/ethics/dynamic-rights-spectrum.svg" alt="Figure 2: Dynamics Rights Spectrum"></p> <p>This tiered approach reflects our current best understanding while remaining open to evolution as our knowledge expands. The framework employs a core governance principle: “Rights scale with capacity for suffering, complexity, and ecological interdependence.” This principle allows us to extend appropriate protections to beings with different capacities without diminishing the importance of human rights.</p> <h2>Special Considerations</h2> <p>Hybrid entities—those combining biological and technological elements or crossing established categories—require case-by-case review by Guardianship Councils. These specialized bodies, described in detail in section 4.4, ensure that novel forms of existence receive appropriate consideration.</p> <p>The framework visualizes this dynamic approach to rights through a spiral-format diagram with color-coded tiers: Red (urgent protections needed), Blue (stable protections in place), and Green (emergent protections developing). This visual model reinforces the developmental nature of rights recognition and the ongoing evolution of our ethical understanding.</p> <p>By acknowledging that different beings require different forms of protection and representation, the Rights of Beings section provides a flexible yet principled approach to expanding our ethical horizons beyond the strictly human domain. It creates space for emerging forms of existence while maintaining clear guidelines for implementation across diverse cultural and political contexts.</p>',1);function l(t){var e=a();n(20),o(t,e)}export{l as default,r as metadata};
