Building on the feedback channels and public engagement strategies of the <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice#06-monitoring-accountability">Monitoring and Accountability</a> section, it outlines methods to involve policymakers, indigenous communities, youth, legal practitioners, and civil society in shaping and implementing the framework. Rooted in the principles of universal access, rule of law, cultural sensitivity, and transparency, it strengthens trust and collaboration across all governance levels.</p> <h3><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h3> <p>Stakeholder engagement is central to the framework’s success, ensuring the justice system reflects the needs and values of all communities. This section details inclusive engagement mechanisms, conflict resolution protocols, and protections for whistleblowers, prioritizing marginalized groups and addressing capacity differences and digital divides. By integrating stakeholder input into decision-making and implementation through evolving co-creation models, it supports the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035.</p> <h3><a id="stakeholder-identification"></a>Stakeholder Identification</h3> <p>A comprehensive approach identifies and prioritizes stakeholders to ensure diverse representation.</p> <ul><li><strong>Key Groups</strong>: <ul><li><strong>Policymakers</strong>: National and regional leaders shaping legal and funding priorities.</li> <li><strong>Indigenous Communities</strong>: Representatives ensuring traditional justice systems are respected.</li> <li><strong>Youth</strong>: Advocates for future-focused justice, including climate and digital issues.</li> <li><strong>Legal Practitioners</strong>: Judges, lawyers, and mediators implementing the framework.</li> <li><strong>Civil Society</strong>: NGOs, community organizations, and advocacy groups promoting equity.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Mapping Process</strong>: Annual stakeholder mapping using participatory workshops and surveys, targeting 90% representation of marginalized groups (e.g., women, low-income communities) by Year 3.</li> <li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: Prioritizes underrepresented regions and groups, with 50% of stakeholder roles reserved for indigenous, youth, and marginalized representatives.</li> <li><strong>Capacity Support</strong>: Travel stipends, translation services, and technical assistance (e.g., digital literacy training) for resource-constrained stakeholders, ensuring 80% participation equity by Year 3.</li></ul> <h3><a id="engagement-mechanisms"></a>Engagement Mechanisms</h3> <p>Structured mechanisms facilitate active stakeholder participation at all levels, with power dynamic management to ensure equitable influence.</p> <ul><li><strong>Global Consultative Forums</strong>: Annual assemblies with 1,000 delegates from all stakeholder groups to guide framework priorities, with virtual and in-person options and facilitation to balance power dynamics (e.g., equal speaking time, small group discussions).</li> <li><strong>Regional Stakeholder Councils</strong>: Biannual meetings led by Regional Justice Hubs, involving 200 local representatives per region to adapt strategies and share best practices, with trained moderators to amplify marginalized voices.</li> <li><strong>National Engagement Panels</strong>: Monthly community dialogues with 500 panels by Year 3, ensuring local input into implementation and monitoring, with priority for underrepresented groups.</li> <li><strong>Digital Engagement Platforms</strong>: Mobile-accessible portals for submitting feedback, integrated with the citizen complaint interface from the <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice#06-monitoring-accountability">Monitoring and Accountability</a> section, targeting 80% stakeholder participation by Year 4.
