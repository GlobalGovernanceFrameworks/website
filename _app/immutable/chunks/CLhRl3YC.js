This section details key milestones for each year, providing a clear roadmap for stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, policymakers, and private sectors—to track progress and ensure accountability. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines, the timeline supports the framework’s <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives">Strategic Objectives</a> and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms">Implementation Mechanisms</a>.</p> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/food-systems/five-year-timeline.svg" alt="Framework Implementation Timeline"></p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>The timeline spans five years, with annual milestones building toward the framework’s 2035 vision of reducing global hunger by 50%, achieving 30% regenerative farmland, and empowering 5 million farmers. Each year includes specific, measurable goals, from stakeholder engagement to policy reforms, supported by regular evaluations to refine strategies. This phased approach ensures steady progress while adapting to regional and global challenges.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: A five-year plan with yearly goals to make food systems fairer and greener, with steps to check progress.</p> <h2><a id="year-1-2025"></a>Year 1 (2025)</h2> <p><strong>Focus</strong>: Lay the foundation for framework adoption and initial implementation.</p>
