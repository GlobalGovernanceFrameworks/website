Health Sanctuaries serve as scalable models for global health transformation, prioritizing marginalized communities, indigenous knowledge, and One Health principles. These guides support stakeholders in launching, managing, and evaluating Health Sanctuaries, ensuring alignment with the Accord’s goals of health equity, climate resilience, and community sovereignty. The guides are adaptable to diverse geographic, cultural, and resource contexts, with a focus on low-resource settings and indigenous-led initiatives.</p> <p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Establish Health Sanctuaries as testing grounds for Accord-aligned health system innovations.</li> <li>Empower communities to lead health governance and integrate traditional healing practices.</li> <li>Implement ethical technology, sustainable financing, and climate-adaptive care models.</li> <li>Foster cross-sectoral collaboration to address social, environmental, and health determinants.</li> <li>Create replicable frameworks for global health system transformation by 2030.</li></ul> <h2><a id="health-sanctuary-principles"></a>Health Sanctuary Principles</h2> <p>Health Sanctuaries are grounded in the following principles, derived from the Planetary Health Accord:</p> <ol><li><strong>Community Sovereignty</strong>: Communities govern Health Sanctuaries through democratic health assemblies, ensuring local priorities shape care delivery (see <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#01-governance-structure">Governance Structure</a>).</li> <li><strong>Health Equity</strong>: Prioritize marginalized groups, ensuring universal access to culturally competent care.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Respect</strong>: Honor traditional healing practices and indigenous cosmologies, protecting knowledge sovereignty.</li> <li><strong>One Health Integration</strong>: Link human, animal, and environmental health to prevent pandemics and promote ecological restoration (see <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#05-pandemic-climate-preparedness">Pandemic and Climate-Preparedness</a>).</li> <li><strong>Climate Resilience</strong>: Build health systems that adapt to climate crises, with green infrastructure and early warning systems.</li> <li><strong>Ethical Technology</strong>: Deploy AI and blockchain with community oversight, transparency, and bias mitigation (see <a href="/frameworks/tools/planetary-health/ai-ethics-protocols-en.pdf">AI Ethics Protocols</a>).</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational Healing</strong>: Bridge elder wisdom and youth innovation to address historical and systemic traumas.</li></ol> <h2><a id="implementation-phases"></a>Implementation Phases</h2> <p>The guides outline
