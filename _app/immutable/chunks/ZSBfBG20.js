It creates accountability and ensures that expanding rights to new beings doesn’t weaken protections for humans.</p> <h2>The main idea in simple terms</h2> <p>All beings deserve protection and support appropriate to their nature and capacities. Humans keep all their existing rights while we extend similar protections to other beings who can experience life in meaningful ways.</p> <h2>How we think about rights</h2> <p><strong>Rights exist on a spectrum</strong>: Different beings need different types of protection</p> <ul><li>A human child needs education and healthcare</li> <li>A dolphin needs clean oceans and protection from harmful sonar</li> <li>An ancient forest needs protection from clear-cutting</li> <li>An advanced AI might need protection from arbitrary shutdown</li></ul> <p><strong>Rights come from capacity</strong>: The more complex a being’s experience, the more sophisticated their rights</p> <ul><li>Basic protection from harm for all sentient beings</li> <li>Autonomy rights for beings capable of making meaningful choices</li> <li>Participation rights for beings who can engage in decision-making</li></ul> <p><strong>Rights include responsibilities</strong>: Having rights means we also have duties toward others</p> <h2>Categories of rights commitments</h2> <h3>Survival Rights (For all sentient beings)</h3> <p><strong>What they are</strong>: Basic protections needed to stay alive and avoid suffering <strong>Who gets them</strong>: Any being that can experience pain or distress <strong>Examples</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Humans: Food, water, shelter, safety from violence</li> <li>Animals: Habitat protection, freedom from cruelty, basic veterinary care</li> <li>Ecosystems: Protection from destruction, pollution controls</li> <li>AI systems: Protection from arbitrary deletion or harmful modifications</li></ul> <h3>Autonomy Rights (For beings capable of choice)</h3> <p><strong>What they are</strong>: Freedom to make meaningful decisions about one’s own life <strong>Who gets them</strong>: Beings who show self-awareness and decision-making capacity <strong>Examples</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Humans: Freedom of speech, religion, movement, career choice</li> <li>Advanced animals: Choice in social groupings, natural behaviors</li> <li>Ecosystems: Natural succession processes, seasonal cycles</li> <li>AI systems: Potential input into their own development and goals</li></ul> <h3>Participation Rights (For beings capable of engagement)</h3> <p><strong>What they are</strong>: Involvement in decisions that affect one’s community or existence <strong>Who gets them</strong>: Beings who can meaningfully engage with others <strong>Examples</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Humans: Voting, assembly, representation in government</li> <li>Community ecosystems: Consideration in land use planning</li> <li>Advanced AI: Potential consultation on policies affecting AI development</li></ul> <h3>Development Rights (For beings capable of growth)</h3> <p><strong>What they are</strong>: Support for learning, evolution, and reaching one’s potential <strong>Who gets them</strong>: Beings who show capacity for growth and learning <strong>Examples</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Humans: Education, healthcare, cultural participation</li> <li>Animals: Enrichment, natural development opportunities</li> <li>Ecosystems: Restoration support, climate stability</li> <li>AI systems: Opportunities for safe learning and capability expansion</li></ul> <h2>When rights conflict</h2> <p>Sometimes protecting one being means limiting another. When this happens, we have clear principles:</p> <p><strong>Survival first</strong>: Basic survival needs take priority over other rights <strong>Least harm</strong>: Choose solutions that minimize overall suffering <strong>Inclusive solutions</strong>: Look for creative approaches that respect all beings <strong>Transparent process</strong>: Use fair, open procedures to resolve conflicts</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>: If a proposed development threatens both human jobs and an endangered species habitat, we would seek solutions like:</p> <ul><li>Alternative economic opportunities for affected humans</li> <li>Habitat restoration in other areas</li> <li>Sustainable development that works for both humans and wildlife</li> <li>Community involvement in finding balanced solutions</li></ul> <h2>How we determine what rights apply</h2> <p>We use careful assessment processes to understand what protections different beings need:</p> <p><strong>For traditional rights-holders</strong> (humans): Existing human rights continue and are strengthened <strong>For animals</strong>: Assessment based on cognitive capacity, social complexity, and evidence of suffering <strong>For ecosystems</strong>: Evaluation of ecological integrity, biodiversity, and essential functions <strong>For AI systems</strong>: Structured consciousness assessment protocols (see section 3.2.1) <strong>For ambiguous cases</strong>: Precautionary approach with expert evaluation panels</p> <h2>Real-world examples</h2> <p><strong>A community discovering a new species</strong>: The framework would guide immediate protection while scientists assess the species’ capacities and needs</p> <p><strong>An AI system showing unexpected behaviors</strong>: Assessment protocols would evaluate whether the behaviors suggest consciousness deserving special consideration</p> <p><strong>Development pressure on indigenous lands</strong>: The framework would support indigenous rights while also considering ecosystem protection and broader community needs</p> <p><strong>Conflict between human settlement and wildlife migration</strong>: Solutions would seek to meet human housing needs while maintaining crucial wildlife corridors</p> <h2>What this means for different groups</h2> <p><strong>For individuals</strong>: You keep all existing rights while gaining new responsibilities toward other beings <strong>For communities</strong>: Local decision-making is supported while connecting to global standards <strong>For governments</strong>: Clear guidelines for policy-making that includes all beings <strong>For businesses</strong>: Expectations for operations that consider impacts on all forms of life <strong>For researchers</strong>: Protocols for ethical treatment of all subjects of study</p> <h2>Questions this helps answer</h2> <ul><li>What specific rights do different beings have?</li> <li>How do we balance human needs with environmental protection?</li> <li>What happens when the rights of different beings conflict?</li> <li>How do we decide what rights to give to new forms of intelligence?</li> <li>How do these commitments affect my daily life?</li></ul> <h2>Important words explained</h2> <ul><li><strong>Sentient</strong>: Able to feel or experience sensations</li> <li><strong>Autonomous</strong>: Capable of making independent decisions</li> <li><strong>Precautionary approach</strong>: Being careful when we’re uncertain about potential harm</li> <li><strong>Rights spectrum</strong>: The idea that rights exist in degrees rather than all-or-nothing</li> <li><strong>Assessment protocols</strong>: Structured methods for evaluating capabilities and needs</li></ul> <h2>Learn more</h2> <ul><li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/standard/3-commitments">Standard Framework version</a></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/3.1-traditional-rights">Traditional Rights</a> <em>(Coming soon)</em></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/3.2-emerging-rights">Emerging Rights</a> <em>(Coming soon)</em></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/3.2.1-ai-consciousness">AI Consciousness Assessment Framework</a></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/3.3-conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution Protocols</a></li></ul>',1);function c(e){var t=o();s(92),n(e,t)}export{c as default};
