This roadmap outlines a four-phase approach that begins with community preparation and foundation-building, scales through pilot demonstration and system development, and culminates in institutional transformation and global solidarity. By centering community leadership while providing technical and political support, this implementation strategy ensures that transformation serves liberation rather than creating new forms of dependence.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>Implementation of transformative water governance cannot follow traditional project management approaches that impose external timelines and metrics on communities. Instead, it requires flexible, adaptive strategies that support community-led transformation while building toward systemic change. This roadmap provides frameworks for action while recognizing that communities will adapt approaches to their specific contexts, priorities, and capacity.</p> <p>The implementation strategy integrates immediate water needs with long-term transformation, community empowerment with technical innovation, and local action with global solidarity. Rather than waiting for perfect conditions, it begins with existing community strengths while building toward more just and sustainable systems through collective action and mutual support.</p>
