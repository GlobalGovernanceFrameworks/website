This comprehensive approach moves beyond disease treatment to community healing, emphasizing prevention, traditional knowledge, and democratic health governance. All healthcare delivery prioritizes community sovereignty, cultural safety, and the understanding that individual health cannot be separated from community and ecosystem well-being.</p> <h2><a

<p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: <strong>Brazil’s Community Health Strategy</strong> demonstrates successful community-centered care at scale. Brazil’s <strong>Family Health Strategy</strong> covers 67% of the population through 44,000 community health teams working in territorially defined areas. Community health workers (Agentes Comunitários de Saúde) are residents of their own communities, providing culturally appropriate care and serving as bridges between formal healthcare and community needs. The program has achieved significant improvements in infant mortality, maternal health, and chronic disease management while respecting local cultural practices and community knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: The <strong>Andean Community Health Sovereignty Initiative</strong> (2026-2030) successfully integrated traditional healing with modern healthcare across 200 indigenous communities in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Traditional healers (curanderos) worked alongside community health workers in democratically governed health assemblies, combining ancient plant medicine knowledge with modern primary care. Youth health advocates documented traditional knowledge while learning modern skills, creating bilingual health education materials. The program achieved 90% community satisfaction and 40% improvement in health outcomes while preserving traditional knowledge and strengthening cultural identity.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: This community-centered delivery system integrates with <a href="#mental-health-integration">Mental Health Integration</a>, <a href="#traditional-healing-integration">Traditional Healing Integration</a>, <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#02-technology-data-infrastructure">Technology and Data Infrastructure</a> for AI-assisted community diagnosis, and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#01-governance-structure">Governance Structure</a> for democratic health service oversight.</p>',1);function u(t){var n=a();o(202),e(t,n)}export{u as default,r as metadata};
