By achieving visible successes quickly, we can build momentum, demonstrate that the framework works, and reduce opposition from people who are skeptical about change.</p> <h2>The main idea in simple terms</h2> <p>Instead of trying to change everything at once, the framework focuses on specific, achievable goals that will show concrete progress and build support for broader changes over time.</p> <h2>Immediate priority goals (2026-2027)</h2> <h3>End harmful testing on intelligent animals</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Stop using primates (monkeys, apes) in research that causes them suffering <strong>Why this matters</strong>: Primates are highly intelligent and emotional beings who suffer significantly in research settings <strong>How it works</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Global agreement to ban painful or invasive primate research</li> <li>Support for developing alternative testing methods that don’t use animals</li> <li>Transition funding to help researchers adopt new approaches</li> <li>Protection for research primates, moving them to appropriate sanctuaries</li></ul> <p><strong>Why this is achievable</strong>: Many countries are already moving in this direction, alternative methods are becoming available, and public support is strong.</p> <h3>Create the first legally recognized river guardian</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Establish legal representation for a major river system <strong>Why this matters</strong>: Shows that ecosystems can have legal rights and effective protection <strong>How it works</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Choose a river system where there’s community support for protection</li> <li>Create legal framework recognizing the river as having rights</li> <li>Establish a guardianship council with diverse representation</li> <li>Give guardians real authority to protect the river’s interests</li> <li>Create funding for ongoing river protection and restoration</li></ul> <p><strong>Why this is achievable</strong>: New Zealand and other countries have already done this successfully, providing a proven model.</p> <h3>Develop standard AI ethics review process</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Create agreed-upon methods for evaluating whether AI systems are ethical <strong>Why this matters</strong>: AI is advancing rapidly, and we need systematic ways to ensure it serves all beings <strong>How it works</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Develop clear criteria for evaluating AI systems</li> <li>Create assessment tools that different organizations can use</li> <li>Focus first on AI systems that have major impacts on people’s lives</li> <li>Establish review processes before AI systems are widely deployed</li> <li>Include diverse perspectives in AI evaluation, not just technology experts</li></ul> <p><strong>Why this is achievable</strong>: There’s growing recognition that AI needs ethical oversight, and many organizations want clear guidelines.</p> <h3>Protect Indigenous knowledge systems</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Create secure, Indigenous-controlled databases for traditional knowledge about nature and relationships with other beings <strong>Why this matters</strong>: Indigenous communities have invaluable knowledge about living sustainably with other beings <strong>How it works</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Work with Indigenous communities to identify knowledge they want to preserve and share</li> <li>Create digital and physical storage systems controlled by Indigenous communities</li> <li>Establish protocols for who can access knowledge and how it can be used</li> <li>Ensure Indigenous communities benefit when their knowledge helps others</li> <li>Protect sacred or sensitive knowledge from inappropriate use</li></ul> <p><strong>Why this is achievable</strong>: Many Indigenous communities want to preserve their knowledge, and technology exists to create secure storage systems.</p> <h3>Create digital rights certification for companies</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Voluntary standards that show companies are developing technology ethically <strong>Why this matters</strong>: Gives consumers and investors ways to support ethical technology development <strong>How it works</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Develop clear standards for ethical technology practices</li> <li>Create certification process for companies that meet standards</li> <li>Include criteria for protecting privacy, preventing bias, and considering impacts on all beings</li> <li>Provide marketing and business benefits for certified companies</li> <li>Create incentives for companies to improve their practices</li></ul> <p><strong>Why this is achievable</strong>: Many companies want to demonstrate ethical practices, and certification programs exist in other areas.</p> <h2>Building support and reducing resistance</h2> <h3>Address economic concerns</h3> <p><strong>Economic impact studies</strong>: Research and prizes for demonstrating the economic benefits of framework implementation <strong>Small business support</strong>: Grants and assistance for smaller companies to adopt ethical practices <strong>Job transition help</strong>: Support for workers whose jobs change as industries become more ethical</p> <h3>Work with different value systems</h3> <p><strong>Religious leader engagement</strong>: Conversations with faith leaders about how the framework aligns with spiritual values <strong>Traditional practice protection</strong>: Ensuring that cultural and agricultural traditions can continue within the framework <strong>National sovereignty respect</strong>: Showing how countries can implement the framework while maintaining independence</p> <h3>Industry partnerships</h3> <p><strong>Technology company alliances</strong>: Working with forward-thinking tech companies to develop ethical AI <strong>Extractive industry transition</strong>: Partnerships with mining, logging, and other industries to develop sustainable practices <strong>Agricultural heritage programs</strong>: Supporting farmers and ranchers in maintaining traditional practices while improving animal welfare</p> <h3>Demonstration projects</h3> <p><strong>Success showcases</strong>: High-profile examples of how traditional knowledge enhances rather than conflicts with modern practices <strong>Value alignment initiatives</strong>: Showing how ethical practices serve business and community interests <strong>Sovereignty-affirming models</strong>: Examples of framework implementation that strengthens rather than weakens local control</p> <h2>Why these goals were chosen</h2> <h3>High visibility</h3> <p>Each goal creates visible change that people can see and understand, building credibility for the framework.</p> <h3>Broad appeal</h3> <p>These goals connect to values held by different communities—animal protection, environmental conservation, ethical technology, cultural preservation.</p> <h3>Manageable scope</h3> <p>Each goal is specific and achievable within a few years, avoiding the overwhelm that comes with trying to change everything at once.</p> <h3>Foundation building</h3> <p>Success with these goals creates the knowledge, relationships, and institutional foundations needed for larger changes.</p> <h3>Multiple entry points</h3> <p>Different communities can engage with different goals based on their interests and priorities.</p> <h2>How you can help achieve these goals</h2> <h3>Learn and share</h3> <ul><li>Understand why these goals matter</li> <li>Share information with your community</li> <li>Connect these goals to issues your community cares about</li></ul>
