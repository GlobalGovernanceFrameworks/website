The Spiral represents different worldviews through which individuals and societies make meaning of the world—from survival-focused to tribal, power-oriented, order-based, achievement-driven, egalitarian, systemic, and holistic perspectives.</p> <p>Rather than imposing a single ethical viewpoint, we recognize that different cultures, communities, and individuals operate through different meaning-making systems. Our framework aims to meet each worldview where it stands while creating pathways for growth and integration.</p> <p>Throughout this document, you’ll find references to different “stages” or “colors” of development (e.g., Blue, Green, Yellow), representing these varying worldviews. These are not hierarchical judgments but recognitions of different complexity levels in approaching ethics and rights.</p> <p><em>For a deeper understanding of the Spiral approach, please refer to the Spiral-Aware Rights Primer available at the end of the document (appendix 6.8)</em></p>",1);function m(e){var t=n();r(10),i(e,t)}export{m as default,o as metadata};
