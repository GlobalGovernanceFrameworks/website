demonstrates successful spiritual healing integration. The <strong>Tibet Autonomous Region</strong> integrates traditional Tibetan medicine with modern healthcare through government-supported <strong>Tibetan Medicine Hospitals</strong> that incorporate Buddhist spiritual practices, meditation, and holistic healing approaches. Tibetan doctors train in both traditional spiritual healing and modern medicine, treating patients through combined approaches that address physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions. The integration respects Buddhist cosmology while meeting modern medical standards, showing how spiritual traditions can enhance rather than conflict with evidence-based healthcare.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: The <strong>Amazon Sacred Health Sanctuary Network</strong> (2026-2031) successfully integrated indigenous spirituality with modern healthcare across 100 communities in the Amazon Basin. Shamanic healers worked alongside Community Health Legions, combining plant medicine ceremonies with modern medical care while maintaining full cultural sovereignty. Sacred sites were protected as healing centers, with traditional plant medicine gardens integrated into modern clinics. Youth spiritual healers trained in both traditional ceremonies and modern healthcare became bridges between worlds, creating healing approaches that honored both indigenous cosmology and scientific medicine while achieving remarkable health outcomes and cultural preservation.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: This spiritual framing integrates with all framework sections, providing spiritual foundation for <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#06-community-centered-healthcare">Community-Centered Healthcare Delivery</a> through sacred healing relationships, <a href="#indigenous-spirituality-healing-cosmologies">Indigenous Spirituality</a> supporting <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#13-global-knowledge-commons">Traditional Knowledge Commons</a>, <a href="#sacred-ecology-planetary-stewardship">Sacred Ecology</a> connecting <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#05-pandemic-climate-preparedness">Pandemic and Climate-Health Preparedness</a>, and <a href="#spiritual-resilience-community-healing">Spiritual Resilience</a> supporting <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#06-community-centered-healthcare">Mental Health Integration</a> with traditional trauma healing and modern therapy integration.</p>',1);function p(i){var t=o();a(164),n(i,t)}export{p as default,r as metadata};
