The framework identifies and establishes standards for these emerging rights areas:</p> <p><strong>Environmental Rights</strong> extend beyond human-centered concerns to recognize the inherent value and legal standing of natural entities. These include:</p> <ul><li>Rights of ecosystems to exist, flourish, and regenerate their natural cycles</li> <li>Rights of species to habitat, genetic diversity, and freedom from anthropogenic extinction</li> <li>Rights of specific natural entities (rivers, mountains, forests) to legal personhood and protection</li> <li>Human rights to a healthy environment, clean air, and water</li></ul> <p><strong>Digital Rights</strong> address the growing importance of digital spaces in human life and the ethical questions raised by advanced technologies:</p> <ul><li>Right to digital privacy and control over personal data</li> <li>Right to algorithmic transparency and non-manipulation</li> <li>Right to digital identity and digital self-determination</li> <li>Protection from surveillance, digital coercion, and exclusion</li> <li>Right to equitable access to digital infrastructure</li></ul> <p><strong>AI/Space Rights</strong> establish ethical guidelines for rapidly advancing technological and space exploration frontiers:</p> <ul><li>Ethical development and use frameworks for artificial intelligence</li> <li>Participatory oversight of AI systems with significant social impact</li> <li>Protections for potential AI consciousness (subject to assessment standards)</li> <li>Ethical guidelines for space exploration and resource utilization</li> <li>Preservation of celestial bodies for scientific, cultural, and future generations</li></ul> <p><strong>Data Dignity</strong> recognizes the unique challenges of the information age:</p> <ul><li>Right to understand how one’s data is used and monetized</li> <li>Right to algorithmic transparency and non-manipulation</li> <li>Protection from harmful data-driven discrimination</li> <li>Right to fair value exchange for personal data contributions</li></ul> <p>These emerging rights categories raise profound questions about consciousness, suffering, and moral consideration: “What does it mean to suffer in code? To hope in algorithms? To dream in data?” The framework establishes structured approaches to these questions, balancing precautionary protections with evidence-based assessment.</p>",1);function h(i){var e=s();a(20),n(i,e)}export{h as default,o as metadata};
