This system map visualizes the framework as Indigenous peoples understand systems—as webs of relationship, seasonal cycles, and flowing connections that strengthen through use and adapt through wisdom. Each component exists in relationship to all others, creating resilience through diversity and strength through unity.</p> <p>This visualization honors Indigenous ways of seeing systems as circles rather than pyramids, flows rather than fixed structures, and relationships rather than isolated components. The system map demonstrates how Traditional Ecological Knowledge, bioregional governance, cultural revitalization, and technological sovereignty weave together into a coherent framework for planetary healing.</p> <h2><a id="framework-system-overview"></a>Framework System Overview</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“Everything is connected.
