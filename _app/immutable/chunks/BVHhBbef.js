Whether you’re addressing immediate water needs or building long-term community power, these proven approaches help you start where you are while building toward transformative change.</p> <p><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Every community has strengths, knowledge, and capacity to improve their water situation. This guide helps you build on what you have while accessing support for what you need.</p> <hr> <h2>Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-6)</h2> <h3>Step 1: Form Your Community Water Circle (Month 1)</h3> <p><strong>Start Small and Inclusive</strong>: Begin with 5-8 committed community members representing diverse perspectives including women, youth, elders, and different community areas or groups.</p> <p><strong>Essential Participants</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Community leaders (formal and informal)</li> <li>Women who collect or manage household water</li> <li>Youth who can bring energy and innovation</li> <li>Elders with traditional knowledge and wisdom</li> <li>Representatives from different neighborhoods or groups</li></ul> <p><strong>First Meeting Agenda</strong>:</p> <ol><li><strong>Share Water Stories</strong> (30 minutes): Each person shares their water challenges and hopes</li> <li><strong>Map Community Water</strong> (45 minutes): Draw simple map of water sources, problems, and assets</li> <li><strong>Identify Priorities</strong> (30 minutes): What are the most urgent water needs?</li> <li><strong>Plan Next Steps</strong> (15 minutes): When will you meet again and who else should join?</li></ol> <p><strong>Tools You Need</strong>: Large paper, markers, snacks for sharing, and community space for meeting</p> <h3>Step 2: Conduct Community Water Assessment (Month 2)</h3> <p><strong>Simple Community Mapping</strong>: Work together to document:</p> <ul><li><strong>Water Sources</strong>: Where does your community get water?
