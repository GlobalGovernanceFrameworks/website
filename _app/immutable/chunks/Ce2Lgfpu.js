Guiding Principles</h1> <p><strong>In this section:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li> <li><a href="#core-principles">Core Principles</a></li> <li><a href="#principles-hierarchy">Principles Hierarchy</a></li> <li><a href="#operational-integration">Operational Integration</a></li> <li><a href="#cultural-adaptation">Cultural Adaptation</a></li></ul> <p><strong>Estimated Reading Time</strong>: 12 minutes</p> <p>These eleven guiding principles form the ethical and operational foundation of transformative water governance. They translate the Theory of Change into actionable values that guide decision-making at every scale, from household water management to international treaty negotiations. More than abstract ideals, these principles provide concrete guidance for navigating complex trade-offs while maintaining alignment with justice, sustainability, and regeneration.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>Effective principles serve as both compass and anchor—pointing toward transformative outcomes while grounding action in non-negotiable values. These principles emerge from Indigenous wisdom traditions, human rights frameworks, ecological science, and decades of community organizing for water justice. They recognize that technical solutions without ethical foundations consistently fail to achieve sustainable transformation.</p> <p>Each principle includes operational definitions that translate values into practice, real-world examples that demonstrate successful application, and guidance for implementation across diverse contexts. Together, they create a coherent framework for water governance that serves life rather than extraction.</p> <h2><a id="core-principles"></a>Core Principles</h2> <h3><strong>1. Human Rights-Based Approach</strong></h3> <p>Water and sanitation are universal human rights that must be upheld regardless of economic status, geographic location, or political circumstances. This principle requires governments to respect, protect, and fulfill water rights through non-discriminatory policies, meaningful participation, and accountability mechanisms that enable rights-holders to seek redress when rights are violated.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: All water governance decisions must prioritize universal access to safely managed water and sanitation as legally enforceable rights. This means progressive realization toward universal coverage, with immediate attention to the most marginalized populations and prohibition of retrogressive measures that reduce access.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: South Africa’s constitutional recognition of water rights in Section 27 has enabled communities to successfully challenge government failures to provide basic services. In <em>Mazibuko v. City of Johannesburg</em>, while the Constitutional Court’s ruling was limited, it established important precedents for community participation in water governance and government obligations to ensure progressive realization of water rights.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Establish independent water ombudspersons, create legal aid programs for water rights litigation, and mandate human rights impact assessments for all water policies and projects.</p> <h3><strong>2. Water as Sacred, Commons, Non-Commodified Public Good and Living Entity</strong></h3> <p>Water embodies spiritual, cultural, ecological, and legal personhood value that cannot be reduced to commodity relationships. This principle rejects speculative commodification while protecting communal stewardship systems and recognizing water’s agency as a living entity with inherent rights.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Non-commodification ensures water access as a right while allowing equitable market-based tools (e.g., stewardship incentives) that prioritize equity over profit. Water systems must be managed as commons with community governance and protection from financialization that treats water as a speculative investment.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: New Zealand’s recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal person in 2017, following decades of Māori advocacy, demonstrates how Indigenous worldviews can reshape legal frameworks. The river now has legal standing through appointed guardians, creating precedent for Rights of Nature approaches globally.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: A bioregional water confederation spanning multiple watersheds could operate through traditional Indigenous councils integrated with modern basin management, where water allocation decisions require consensus between human communities and appointed “speakers” for river systems, wetlands, and aquifers.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Enact Rights of Nature legislation, establish river guardianship programs with Indigenous leadership, and create legal frameworks that prohibit water futures trading while supporting community-controlled stewardship incentives.</p> <h3><strong>3. Intergenerational Responsibility</strong></h3> <p>Present water governance decisions must ensure future generations’ access to clean water and healthy watersheds through 50-year impact assessments and institutional mechanisms that represent future generations’ interests in current decision-making.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: All major water infrastructure, policy, and governance decisions must undergo intergenerational impact assessment evaluating consequences across multiple generations. Governance structures must include formal representation of youth and future generations’ interests.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Seven Generation Principle guides decision-making by considering impacts seven generations into the future. This principle has been adopted by various environmental laws and organizations, demonstrating how Indigenous governance wisdom can inform contemporary policy frameworks.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Establish Youth Water Parliaments with advisory authority, mandate 50-year environmental impact assessments for water projects, and create Children’s Water Rights Advocates as legal representatives for future generations.</p> <h3><strong>4. Sustainability</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must balance ecological, economic, and social factors for long-term viability, prioritizing regenerative approaches that enhance rather than degrade natural systems while meeting human needs within planetary boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Sustainability requires operating within watershed carrying capacity, maintaining ecosystem services that support long-term water security, and using governance and economic models that can be maintained indefinitely without external subsidies or environmental degradation.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: Costa Rica’s Payment for Ecosystem Services program compensates upstream landowners for watershed protection, creating economic incentives for conservation that maintain water quality for downstream users. The program has increased forest cover while improving water security, demonstrating how economic and ecological sustainability can align.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Implement watershed-based carrying capacity assessments, establish payments for ecosystem services programs, and require regenerative impact standards for all water infrastructure projects.</p> <h3><strong>5. Equity & Inclusion</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must prioritize marginalized groups including women, rural communities, urban poor, Indigenous peoples, migrant populations, climate refugees, and unbanked populations, ensuring non-discrimination and meaningful participation in decision-making processes.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Equity requires specific targets for marginalized group participation (e.g., 50% women in WASH governance roles), affirmative resource allocation to address historical exclusions, and governance structures that enable meaningful participation by all affected communities.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: Kerala’s Kudumbashree program has empowered over 4 million women to participate in water and sanitation management through self-help groups and local governance structures. The program demonstrates how gender equity initiatives can improve both water access and women’s political participation.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Establish mandatory gender and social inclusion quotas for water governance bodies, create targeted funding for marginalized community water projects, and implement accessibility standards for all water and sanitation infrastructure.</p> <h3><strong>6. Transparency & Accountability</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must foster trust through open decision-making processes, public access to information, meaningful participation opportunities, and robust accountability mechanisms that enable communities to hold institutions responsible for their commitments.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Transparency requires public access to all water-related data, budgets, and decision-making processes. Accountability requires independent oversight mechanisms, regular public reporting, and accessible grievance procedures with binding resolution authority.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: Brazil’s water committee system (comitês de bacia hidrográfica) includes representatives from government, civil society, and water users in watershed management decisions. Public meetings, online data platforms, and regular reporting requirements have increased transparency while enabling community oversight of water resource management.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Establish open data mandates for water information, create community oversight committees with budget review authority, and implement participatory audit processes with binding recommendations.</p> <h3><strong>7. Climate Resilience</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must integrate adaptive strategies for climate-induced challenges including droughts, floods, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and shifting precipitation patterns, while contributing to climate mitigation through sustainable water management practices.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Climate resilience requires governance structures that can rapidly adapt to changing conditions, infrastructure designed for climate variability rather than historical averages, and integration of water management with broader climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: The Netherlands’ “Room for the River” program transformed flood management from controlling rivers through dikes to giving rivers space to flood safely. This approach has reduced flood risks while creating recreational areas and restoring wetland ecosystems, demonstrating integrated climate adaptation approaches.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Develop adaptive management protocols for climate uncertainty, implement nature-based solutions for climate resilience, and integrate water planning with Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.</p> <h3><strong>8. Anti-Privatization Safeguards</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must oppose predatory privatization that restricts access while supporting ethical public-private partnerships that maintain public ownership, democratic control, and universal access commitments.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Public control means democratic oversight of water services through accountable institutions, with any private sector involvement required to maintain public ownership of infrastructure, universal access obligations, and community participation in governance.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: Paris’s return of water services to public control in 2010 after decades of private management has reduced costs while improving service quality and transparency. The city saved €35 million annually while increasing investment in infrastructure and international cooperation, demonstrating successful re-municipalization.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Establish legal frameworks that prevent water privatization, create technical assistance programs for public water utilities, and develop ethical partnership standards that maintain public control and universal access obligations.</p> <h3><strong>9. Trauma-Informed WASH</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must address needs of conflict and disaster survivors, recognizing how water insecurity creates and compounds trauma while designing healing-centered approaches that restore dignity and agency alongside access to services.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Trauma-informed approaches prioritize safety, trustworthiness, peer support, collaboration, empowerment, and attention to cultural, historical, and gender issues in all water programming, especially in crisis and post-crisis contexts.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: In refugee camps in Jordan hosting Syrian refugees, UNICEF’s trauma-informed WASH programming includes separate facilities for men and women, community feedback mechanisms, and integration with psychosocial support services. This approach has improved both utilization rates and mental health outcomes.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Train all water sector workers in trauma-informed approaches, establish community feedback mechanisms in all programming, and integrate WASH with mental health and psychosocial support services.</p> <h3><strong>10. Decolonial Lens</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must actively undo extractive legacies by centering Indigenous and local knowledge systems, challenging colonial governance structures, and supporting community self-determination in water management.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Decolonial approaches require recognizing Indigenous sovereignty over traditional territories, centering Indigenous knowledge systems in governance, and actively dismantling colonial legal and institutional frameworks that enable water extraction and commodification.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Real)</strong>: The Maasai community in Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Conservation Area has maintained traditional water management systems that preserve both wildlife habitat and community water security. However, government restrictions on traditional practices have undermined both conservation and community wellbeing, demonstrating the importance of supporting rather than suppressing Indigenous governance systems.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Implement Free, Prior, and Informed Consent protocols for all water projects affecting Indigenous communities, establish Indigenous water governance training programs, and create legal frameworks that protect traditional water management systems.</p> <h3><strong>11. Planetary Healing</strong></h3> <p>Water governance must promote restoration and reconciliation with Earth’s water systems, addressing historical ecological traumas through regenerative practices that heal damaged watersheds while strengthening human-water relationships.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition</strong>: Planetary healing requires governance approaches that actively restore ecosystem health, reconnect human communities with natural water cycles, and address historical damage from extractive practices through restorative justice approaches.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: A bioregional healing initiative in the Colorado River Basin could integrate Indigenous fire management, wetland restoration, regenerative agriculture, and urban water recycling to address over-allocation while honoring the river’s life-giving capacity and supporting diverse communities dependent on the watershed.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>: Develop watershed restoration programs led by Indigenous communities, establish ecological restoration targets integrated with water access goals, and create funding mechanisms that prioritize healing over exploitation.</p> <h2><a id="principles-hierarchy"></a>Principles Hierarchy</h2> <p>When principles appear to conflict in specific situations, this hierarchy provides guidance for decision-making while requiring participatory processes to navigate complex trade-offs:</p> <h3><strong>Primary Principles (Non-Negotiable)</strong></h3> <ol><li><strong>Human Rights-Based Approach</strong> - Universal access to water and sanitation cannot be compromised</li> <li><strong>Water as Sacred Commons</strong> - Water’s fundamental nature as public good and living entity must be protected</li> <li><strong>Equity & Inclusion</strong> - Marginalized communities’ needs take priority in resource allocation</li></ol> <h3><strong>Secondary Principles (Strong Preference)</strong></h3> <ol start="4"><li><strong>Intergenerational Responsibility</strong> - Long-term sustainability guides short-term decisions</li> <li><strong>Transparency & Accountability</strong> - Open governance enables other principles’ realization</li> <li><strong>Decolonial Lens</strong> - Indigenous sovereignty and knowledge must be centered</li></ol> <h3><strong>Operational Principles (Implementation Guidance)</strong></h3> <ol start="7"><li><strong>Climate Resilience</strong> - Adaptation essential for long-term sustainability</li> <li><strong>Anti-Privatization Safeguards</strong> - Public control necessary for rights realization</li> <li><strong>Trauma-Informed WASH</strong> - Healing approaches enhance effectiveness</li> <li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Ecological limits frame all interventions</li> <li><strong>Planetary Healing</strong> - Regenerative approaches guide long-term vision</li></ol> <h3><strong>Conflict Resolution Process</strong></h3> <p>When principles conflict, use this process:</p> <ol><li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: Include all affected communities in dialogue</li> <li><strong>Indigenous Consultation</strong>: Prioritize Indigenous knowledge and leadership</li> <li><strong>Rights Impact Assessment</strong>: Evaluate effects on human rights realization</li> <li><strong>Adaptive Solutions</strong>: Seek creative approaches that honor multiple principles</li> <li><strong>Monitoring & Adjustment</strong>: Track outcomes and adjust as needed</li></ol> <p><strong>Example Application</strong>: If climate resilience infrastructure (Principle 7) might displace Indigenous communities (Principle 10), the hierarchy requires prioritizing Indigenous sovereignty while seeking adaptive solutions that achieve climate goals through Indigenous-led approaches.</p> <h2><a id="operational-integration"></a>Operational Integration</h2> <h3><strong>Decision-Making Integration</strong></h3> <p>Every governance decision should be evaluated against all eleven principles through structured assessment processes. This integration prevents compartmentalized thinking while ensuring comprehensive attention to multiple values simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Tool</strong>: Use the <a href="/frameworks/tools/water/principles-assessment-matrix-en.pdf">Principles Assessment Matrix</a> to evaluate proposed policies, projects, and governance changes against all principles with scoring and improvement recommendations.</p> <h3><strong>Institutional Integration</strong></h3> <p>Governance institutions must embed these principles in their structures, processes, and accountability mechanisms. This includes constitutional recognition, legislative frameworks, regulatory standards, and institutional mandates that operationalize principles rather than treating them as aspirational statements.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Approach</strong>: Establish Principles Compliance Officers within water institutions, mandate annual principles reporting, and create community oversight mechanisms that monitor principles implementation.</p> <h3><strong>Resource Allocation Integration</strong></h3> <p>Financial planning and resource allocation must explicitly prioritize actions that advance multiple principles simultaneously while ensuring adequate resources for principles implementation rather than treating them as unfunded mandates.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Strategy</strong>: Develop principles-based budgeting that allocates resources according to principles priorities, establishes dedicated funding for marginalized community participation, and tracks spending against principles outcomes.</p> <h2><a id="cultural-adaptation"></a>Cultural Adaptation</h2> <h3><strong>Regional Customization</strong></h3> <p>While these principles provide universal guidance, their application must be adapted to diverse cultural contexts, legal systems, and local conditions while maintaining core commitments to human rights, equity, and ecological sustainability.</p> <p><strong>Adaptation Process</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Cultural Translation</strong>: Work with local knowledge holders to translate principles into culturally appropriate language and concepts</li> <li><strong>Legal Integration</strong>: Adapt principles to local constitutional and legal frameworks while strengthening rather than weakening protections</li> <li><strong>Institutional Alignment</strong>: Build on existing governance traditions while strengthening participation and accountability</li> <li><strong>Community Validation</strong>: Ensure local communities recognize principles as authentic to their values and aspirations</li></ul> <h3><strong>Indigenous Knowledge Integration</strong></h3> <p>These principles must be enriched through engagement with Indigenous knowledge systems that offer deeper understanding of sustainable human-water relationships developed over millennia.</p> <p><strong>Integration Approach</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Knowledge Dialogue</strong>: Create respectful processes for sharing between Indigenous knowledge holders and framework developers</li> <li><strong>Co-Governance</strong>: Establish formal Indigenous leadership roles in principles development and implementation</li> <li><strong>Intellectual Property Protection</strong>: Ensure Indigenous knowledge contributions are acknowledged and protected from appropriation</li> <li><strong>Continuous Learning</strong>: Maintain ongoing relationships for deepening principles understanding through Indigenous wisdom</li></ul> <h3><strong>Youth and Elder Wisdom</strong></h3> <p>Principles must bridge intergenerational knowledge by honoring elder wisdom while creating space for youth innovation and leadership in water governance transformation.</p> <p><strong>Intergenerational Integration</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Elder Councils</strong>: Formal advisory roles for traditional knowledge holders and community elders</li> <li><strong>Youth Leadership</strong>: Decision-making authority rather than token participation for young water stewards</li> <li><strong>Knowledge Exchange</strong>: Structured programs for sharing between generations</li> <li><strong>Innovation Support</strong>: Resources for youth-led innovations in principles application</li></ul> <hr> <p><strong>Principles Application</strong>: These guiding principles inform every aspect of framework implementation, from institutional design and financing mechanisms to technology deployment and crisis response. The <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/water#02-institutional-policy-framework">Institutional & Policy Framework</a> section demonstrates how these principles translate into concrete governance structures and legal frameworks.</p> <p><strong>Living Document</strong>: These principles will evolve through implementation experience and ongoing dialogue with water stewards worldwide. Regular review processes will strengthen and deepen principles while maintaining core commitments to justice, sustainability, and regeneration.</p>',1);function m(e){var n=o();a(204),i(e,n)}export{m as default,r as metadata};
