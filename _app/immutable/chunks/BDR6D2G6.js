Rooted in human rights, planetary stewardship, and Indigenous wisdom, this framework reimagines water governance as a pathway to justice, resilience, and regeneration. From sacred water ceremonies in Andean communities to cutting-edge smart water grids in urban centers, this framework bridges ancient wisdom with innovative technologies, empowering communities, governments, and organizations worldwide to co-create a future where water flows as a force for healing and justice.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>This framework represents the culmination of visionary thinking and practical implementation strategies, addressing the interconnected crises of water scarcity, climate change, and systemic inequity. It integrates human rights-based approaches with regenerative technologies, Indigenous knowledge systems with artificial intelligence, and local governance with global coordination. Aligned with SDG 6 and the broader Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it prioritizes planetary healing, intergenerational justice, and blue democracy.</p> <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To achieve universal access to safely managed water and sanitation by 2030 while regenerating Earth’s hydrological systems, establishing water governance as a foundation for planetary health and social justice.</p> <p><strong>Transformative Vision</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Water recognized as a sacred, living entity with legal rights</li> <li>Universal access achieved through regenerative, climate-resilient infrastructure</li> <li>Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems at the heart of governance</li> <li>Communities empowered as water stewards and decision-makers</li> <li>Technology serving equity rather than extraction</li> <li>Water conflicts transformed into cooperation and healing</li></ul> <p><strong>Key Innovations</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Hydrological Justice</strong>: Systemic approach ensuring equitable water access and ecosystem health</li> <li><strong>Blue Democracy</strong>: Participatory water governance as a fundamental political right</li> <li><strong>Liquid Ethics</strong>: Flexible, principled approaches to complex water governance realities</li> <li><strong>Water as Living Entity</strong>: Legal personhood recognition following Indigenous worldviews</li> <li><strong>Regenerative WASH</strong>: Infrastructure that heals rather than extracts</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational Governance</strong>: Youth-Elder councils and 50-year impact assessments</li> <li><strong>Digital Water Commons</strong>: AI and blockchain serving community empowerment</li> <li><strong>Planetary Healing</strong>: Water governance as reconciliation with Earth’s systems</li></ul> <h2><a id="framework-sections"></a>Framework Sections</h2> <p>The framework flows organically from foundational vision through practical implementation, maintaining the integrated complexity essential to transformative water governance:</p> <p><strong><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/water#theory-of-change">Theory of Change</a></strong>: Maps how systemic inequities and environmental degradation can be transformed through human rights-based governance, regenerative technologies, and community empowerment.</p> <p><strong><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/water#01-guiding-principles">1.
