Resource Justice & Economic Rights</h4> <ul><li><strong>Equitable Resource Management</strong>: Governance systems preventing resource-based conflict drivers</li> <li><strong>Fair Distribution Mechanisms</strong>: Frameworks ensuring essential resources benefit all communities</li> <li><strong>Economic Violence Prevention</strong>: Addressing systemic economic exclusion that fuels grievances</li> <li><strong>Post-Conflict Economic Recovery</strong>: Targeted reconstruction that addresses inequalities</li></ul> <h4>2. Identity & Recognition Justice</h4> <ul><li><strong>Cultural Rights Protection</strong>: Guaranteed respect for ethnic, religious, and cultural identities</li> <li><strong>Anti-Discrimination Frameworks</strong>: Systematic prevention of structural violence against marginalized groups</li> <li><strong>Hate Speech Monitoring</strong>: Early intervention against dehumanization and vilification</li> <li><strong>Recognition Politics</strong>: Acknowledgment of historical injustices and dignity violations</li> <li><strong>Intersectional Approaches</strong>: Recognizing how multiple identities (including disability, gender, ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status) intersect to create unique experiences of marginalization and vulnerability during conflict, and ensuring peace processes address these overlapping dimensions rather than treating identity categories in isolation</li></ul> <h4>3. Political Inclusion & Power-Sharing</h4> <ul><li><strong>Inclusive Political Processes</strong>: Mechanisms ensuring all groups have meaningful political voice</li> <li><strong>Constitutional Power-Sharing</strong>: Governance structures preventing domination by majority groups</li> <li><strong>Democratic Peace-Strengthening</strong>: Building the conflict-prevention aspects of democratic systems</li> <li><strong>Minority Rights Protection</strong>: Guarantees against majoritarian abuses</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study</strong>: Northern Ireland’s Good Friday Agreement addressed structural conflict drivers through power-sharing government, human rights guarantees, cultural recognition, and cross-border institutions. By creating inclusive political structures, addressing identity and recognition needs, and implementing concrete security reforms, the agreement transformed a seemingly intractable conflict. Despite ongoing challenges, this comprehensive approach demonstrates how addressing root causes can create sustainable peace.</p> <h4>4. Youth, Peace & Security</h4> <ul><li><strong>Youth Leadership in Peacebuilding</strong>: Structured roles for young people in peace processes and governance</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational Dialogue</strong>: Mechanisms connecting youth perspectives with traditional leadership</li> <li><strong>Youth-Led Early Warning</strong>: Leveraging youth networks for conflict prevention and monitoring</li> <li><strong>Educational & Economic Peace Dividends</strong>: Ensuring post-conflict benefits specifically address youth needs</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study</strong>: The Youth, Peace and Security agenda, formalized through UN Security Council Resolution 2250, has transformed youth participation in Colombia’s peace process. Young people moved from being primarily viewed as victims or perpetrators to becoming essential peacebuilders. Through initiatives like the Youth Peace Caucus, young Colombians directly influenced peace agreement provisions, monitored implementation, and led reconciliation efforts in communities. This demonstrates how meaningful youth inclusion strengthens peace processes by incorporating forward-looking perspectives and building generational sustainability.</p>",1);function d(e){var i=s();o(22),t(e,i)}export{d as default,r as metadata};
