This comprehensive financing system moves beyond traditional conservation funding to create innovative mechanisms that honor indigenous sovereignty, prioritize Global South leadership, and ensure community control over resources. Through the $10 billion Global Biodiversity Fund and complementary financial instruments, this framework demonstrates that planetary healing is not only morally imperative but economically viable, profitable, and sustainable when aligned with justice principles and traditional knowledge systems.</p> <h2><a id="global-biodiversity-fund-structure"></a>Global Biodiversity Fund Structure</h2>
