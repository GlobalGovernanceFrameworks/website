The kit includes conflict analysis templates, local peace committee charters, early warning protocols, dialogue facilitation guides, and regionally-adaptable resources. This practical starting point enables peace practitioners to rapidly deploy evidence-based approaches while maintaining alignment with the broader governance framework.

By establishing individual criminal responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, the ICC has shifted international norms and demonstrated that even high-ranking officials may face consequences for atrocities. The Court’s complementarity principle—operating only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute—creates incentives for states to improve their domestic justice systems while providing recourse when they fail.</p>',1);function d(e){var i=r();a(12),n(e,i)}export{d as default,o as metadata};
