The kit includes conflict analysis templates, local peace committee charters, early warning protocols, dialogue facilitation guides, and regionally-adaptable resources. This practical starting point enables peace practitioners to rapidly deploy evidence-based approaches while maintaining alignment with the broader governance framework.

During political crises in The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and other member states, ECOWAS has used a combination of diplomatic pressure, economic incentives, and the credible threat of intervention to prevent or resolve conflicts. This multi-faceted approach demonstrates how regional organizations can integrate various peacebuilding tools across multiple governance levels.</p>',1);function d(e){var o=r();n(12),t(e,o)}export{d as default,a as metadata};
