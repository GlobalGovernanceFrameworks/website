This section outlines approaches that regenerate damaged ecosystems, work within planetary boundaries, and create abundance through circular economy principles. By integrating Indigenous knowledge with ecological science, these strategies demonstrate how universal water access can enhance rather than degrade environmental health while strengthening climate resilience.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>The climate and biodiversity crises are inseparable from water injustices—all reflect the same extractive systems that treat nature as commodity rather than living partner. Transformative water governance must address root causes while demonstrating that social justice and ecological health strengthen rather than compete with each other.</p> <p>This framework integrates water governance with planetary healing through regenerative management approaches that restore natural hydrological cycles, ecosystem protection that enhances water security, and climate adaptation that builds on rather than displaces traditional knowledge. Rather than treating environmental concerns as constraints on development, it shows how ecological restoration creates the foundation for sustainable prosperity and climate resilience.</p>
