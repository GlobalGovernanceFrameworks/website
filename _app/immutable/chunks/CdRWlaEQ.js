This reflects a philosophical arc: from governing systems to living systems to being itself. The highest governance might not manage complexity, but cultivate simplicity—until governance becomes so attuned to consciousness that it vanishes like scaffolding after construction is complete.</p>",1);function p(e){var i=a();n(30),s(e,i)}export{p as default,r as metadata};
