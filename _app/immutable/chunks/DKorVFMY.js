This structure moves beyond traditional state-centric international organizations to create genuinely inclusive governance that honors both traditional knowledge systems and contemporary democratic innovations. All governance mechanisms prioritize community consent, cultural sovereignty, and the understanding that effective biodiversity protection requires decision-making authority for those who have served as Earth’s most effective stewards.</p> <h2><a id="global-biodiversity-commons-trust"></a>Global Biodiversity Commons Trust (BCT)</h2> <h3>Composition and Representation</h3> <p>The <strong>Global
