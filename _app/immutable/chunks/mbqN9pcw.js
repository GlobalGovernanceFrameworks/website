Unlike traditional UBI, AUBI responds to changing circumstances while maintaining dignity and economic security for all citizens.</p> <h3>Carbon Tax</h3> <p>A levy on fossil fuel production, consumption, and carbon-intensive activities designed to internalize environmental costs while generating revenue for climate adaptation and global public goods. The Treaty’s carbon tax operates globally through coordinated implementation by willing nations.</p> <h3>Climate Reparations</h3> <p>Financial and technological support provided by high-emission nations to frontline communities disproportionately affected by climate change. Based on principles of historical responsibility and differentiated capabilities, reparations fund adaptation, loss and damage compensation, and sustainable development pathways.</p> <h3>Commons Dividend</h3> <p>Direct payments to citizens from revenues generated by global commons exploitation, including carbon pricing, digital platform profits, space resource extraction, and ocean resource use. Modeled on Alaska’s oil dividend but applied to planetary-scale commons.</p> <h3>Debt Justice</h3> <p>Systematic reform of international debt structures to prevent crisis exploitation and ensure sustainable development. Includes automatic debt pause mechanisms during emergencies, odious debt cancellation, and debt sustainability standards that protect essential services.</p> <h3>Ecocide Law</h3> <p>International legal framework criminalizing large-scale environmental destruction. Includes graduated penalties for corporations (revenue-scaled fines) and individuals (criminal liability for executives), with independent oversight to prevent weaponization against developing economies.</p> <h3>Global Stewardship Alliance</h3> <p>Coalition of 30-50 nations committed to implementing Treaty mechanisms internally and through international cooperation. Serves as proof-of-concept demonstration while creating competitive pressure for broader adoption through economic and diplomatic advantages.</p> <h3>Keystone Reforms</h3> <p>Five critical changes that unlock comprehensive transformation: UNSC veto override, ecocide law, carbon tax, global citizens’ initiative, and debt justice. These reforms address multiple problems simultaneously and create conditions for broader institutional evolution.</p> <h3>Payment for Global Public Goods Fund</h3> <p>Independent financing mechanism for global cooperation, funded through carbon taxes, financial transaction levies, and other innovative revenue sources. Governed by tripartite board (citizens, institutions, independent monitors) with transparency and equity covenants.</p> <h3>Polycrisis</h3> <p>Interconnected, cascading failures across climate, economic, political, and social systems that amplify each other in dangerous feedback loops. Distinguished from separate crises by systematic interconnection requiring integrated rather than fragmentary responses.</p> <h3>Sovereignty Bargain</h3> <p>Strategic trade-off where nations limit traditional authorities (like veto power) in exchange for enhanced leadership roles in emerging governance domains (digital governance, climate technology, conflict prevention). Based on European Union’s successful sovereignty pooling model.</p> <h2><a id="institutional-bodies"></a>Institutional Bodies and Mechanisms</h2> <h3>Council of Guardians</h3> <p>Nine-member body serving single 15-year terms, selected from retired judges, scientists, ethicists, and long-term thinkers.
