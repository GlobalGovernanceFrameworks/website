These definitions aim to ensure shared understanding among diverse stakeholders and provide clarity on technical concepts.</p> <h3>Key Terms</h3> <p><strong>Adaptation</strong>: Adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects. It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or benefit from opportunities associated with climate change.</p> <p><strong>Carbon Budget</strong>: The estimated amount of carbon dioxide emissions remaining before reaching a specific global temperature threshold (typically 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels). It represents the maximum amount of carbon that can be released while maintaining a likelihood of limiting warming to that threshold.</p> <p><strong>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</strong>: The process of capturing carbon dioxide from large point sources (such as power plants), transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere, typically underground in geological formations.</p> <p><strong>Carbon Pricing</strong>: A policy tool that puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions, creating financial incentives to reduce emissions. Primary forms include carbon taxes (fixed price per ton) and emissions trading systems (cap-and-trade).</p> <p><strong>Circular Economy</strong>: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling to create a closed-loop system, minimizing resource inputs and waste creation.</p> <p><strong>Climate Finance</strong>: Financial resources devoted to addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation actions, including public, private, and alternative sources of financing. Under the UNFCCC, climate finance specifically refers to “financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation.”</p> <p><strong>Climate Justice</strong>: An approach that frames climate change as an ethical and political issue rather than purely environmental or physical. It examines issues like equality, human rights, collective rights, and historical responsibilities in relation to climate change.</p> <p><strong>Climate-Resilient Development</strong>: A development pathway that strengthens adaptive capacity and reduces climate vulnerability while reducing emissions, supporting sustainable development priorities.</p> <p><strong>Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)</strong>: A principle of international environmental law establishing that all states have a common responsibility to protect the environment, but with differentiated responsibilities based on their different capabilities and contributions to environmental degradation.</p> <p><strong>Early Warning Systems</strong>: Integrated systems of hazard monitoring, forecasting, disaster risk assessment, communication, and preparedness that enable individuals, communities, and organizations to prepare for and respond to climate-related hazards.</p> <p><strong>Green Colonialism</strong>: The imposition of environmental policies, projects, or resource extraction activities that claim environmental benefits while disregarding or harming the rights, interests, and self-determination of local and Indigenous communities.</p> <p><strong>Just Transition</strong>: A framework developed by the labor movement to encompass a range of social interventions needed to secure workers’ and communities’ rights and livelihoods when economies are shifting to more sustainable production, particularly related to climate action.</p> <p><strong>Loss and Damage</strong>: Refers to the impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided through mitigation and adaptation, including both economic (e.g., loss of assets and crops) and non-economic impacts (e.g., loss of cultural heritage, indigenous knowledge, and human health).</p> <p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, changing management practices, or consumer behavior.</p> <p><strong>Nature-based Solutions (NbS)</strong>: Actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits.</p> <p><strong>Net-Zero Emissions</strong>: A state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal from the atmosphere. The term “net” refers to the balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>Planetary Boundaries</strong>: A concept identifying nine processes that regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth system. It proposes quantitative boundaries within which humanity can safely operate, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and biogeochemical flows.</p> <p><strong>Regenerative Economy</strong>: An economic system that works to regenerate and restore natural systems, create shared prosperity, and ensure resilient communities, moving beyond sustainability to actively improving environmental and social conditions.</p> <p><strong>Resource Justice</strong>: The fair and equitable access to natural resources, considering historical inequities, current needs, and future generations’ rights. It encompasses physical resource distribution as well as decision-making power over resource management.</p> <h3>Acronyms</h3> <p><strong>CBDR</strong>: Common But Differentiated Responsibilities</p> <ul><li>A core principle of international climate agreements recognizing different capabilities and responsibilities of nations</li></ul> <p><strong>CCS</strong>: Carbon Capture and Storage</p> <ul><li>Technology that captures CO₂ emissions from sources like power plants and stores them underground</li></ul> <p><strong>COP</strong>: Conference of the Parties</p> <ul><li>The supreme decision-making body of the UNFCCC, meeting annually to assess progress in dealing with climate change</li></ul> <p><strong>FTT</strong>: Financial Transaction Tax</p> <ul><li>A small tax applied to financial transactions that can generate revenue for climate finance</li></ul> <p><strong>GHG</strong>: Greenhouse Gases</p> <ul><li>Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases</li></ul> <p><strong>IPCC</strong>: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</p> <ul><li>The United Nations body responsible for assessing the science related to climate change</li></ul> <p><strong>IRENA</strong>: International Renewable Energy Agency</p> <ul><li>An intergovernmental organization supporting countries in their transition to sustainable energy</li></ul> <p><strong>ISSB</strong>: International Sustainability Standards Board</p> <ul><li>A body developing global sustainability disclosure standards for companies</li></ul> <p><strong>NAP</strong>: National Adaptation Plan</p> <ul><li>A process established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework to identify medium and long-term adaptation needs</li></ul> <p><strong>NDC</strong>: Nationally Determined Contribution</p> <ul><li>Climate action plans submitted by countries under the Paris Agreement</li></ul> <p><strong>NbS</strong>: Nature-based Solutions</p> <ul><li>Actions that protect, sustainably manage, and restore ecosystems while addressing societal challenges</li></ul> <p><strong>SDGs</strong>: Sustainable Development Goals</p> <ul><li>A collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 for the year 2030</li></ul> <p><strong>UNFCCC</strong>: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</p> <ul><li>An international environmental treaty addressing climate change, adopted in 1992</li></ul> <p><strong>WTO</strong>: World Trade Organization</p> <ul><li>The international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations</li></ul> <p><strong>GATT</strong>: General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</p> <ul><li>A treaty designed to promote international trade by reducing or eliminating trade barriers like tariffs, quotas, etc.</li></ul> <p><strong>MRV</strong>: Measurement, Reporting, and Verification</p> <ul><li>A term used to describe the process of measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and verifying the reported data</li></ul> <p><strong>REDD+</strong>: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus</p> <ul><li>A framework for mitigating climate change through forest management in developing countries</li></ul> <p><strong>LDCs</strong>: Least Developed Countries</p> <ul><li>Countries that exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development and require special attention in climate negotiations</li></ul> <p><strong>SIDS</strong>: Small Island Developing States</p> <ul><li>A distinct group of developing countries facing specific social, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities</li></ul> <p><strong>GCF</strong>: Green Climate Fund</p> <ul><li>A fund established within the framework of the UNFCCC to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices</li></ul> <p><strong>JI</strong>: Joint Implementation</p> <ul><li>A mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol allowing developed countries to implement emission-reduction projects in other developed countries</li></ul> <p><strong>CDM</strong>: Clean Development Mechanism</p> <ul><li>A mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol allowing developed countries to implement emission-reduction projects in developing countries</li></ul> <p><strong>ITMOs</strong>: Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes</p> <ul><li>Units of emission reductions that can be transferred between countries under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</li></ul> <p><strong>ESG</strong>: Environmental, Social, and Governance</p> <ul><li>A set of standards for company operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments</li></ul> <p>This glossary serves as a reference point to ensure consistent understanding of the terms and concepts used throughout the framework.
