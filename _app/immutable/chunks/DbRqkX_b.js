By redirecting subsidies, democratizing knowledge, harmonizing policies, and empowering communities, these leverage points amplify the framework’s <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives">Strategic Objectives</a> and align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Paris Agreement. This section equips stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, and policymakers—with high-impact strategies to create resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>Systemic leverage points are critical intervention areas that catalyze widespread change by addressing root causes and amplifying impact. The framework identifies four key leverage points: subsidy redirection, knowledge commons, policy harmonization, and community co-governance. These interventions work synergistically to shift food systems toward sustainability and equity, ensuring alignment with the framework’s <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles">Core Principles</a> of sustainability, equity, resilience, and transparency.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: These are key areas where small changes can make a big difference, like redirecting money or sharing knowledge to improve food systems.</p> <h2><a id="subsidy-redirection"></a>Subsidy Redirection</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Shifting financial incentives from unsustainable practices to regenerative and agroecological methods to support sustainable food production.</p> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Redirect 40% of global agricultural subsidies to regenerative practices by 2030, engaging 100 countries through policy advocacy workshops by 2027.</li> <li>Offer tax breaks and grants for farmers adopting sustainable practices, targeting 1 million farmers by 2028.</li> <li>Reallocate fossil fuel subsidies to fund rural infrastructure, such as irrigation and storage systems.</li></ul> <p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Scales regenerative farmland to 30% by 2035.</li> <li>Reduces environmental degradation and supports carbon sequestration.</li></ul> <p><strong>Success Stories</strong>:</p> <ul><li><em>Costa Rica</em>: Since 1997, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) redirected $500M to farmers, reversing deforestation and increasing forest cover by 50%, benefiting 8,000 farming families.</li> <li><em>European Union</em>: “Farm to Fork” strategy redirected €100B in subsidies toward organic farming, leading to 19% of farmland under organic production by 2022.</li> <li><em>Brazil</em>: Family Farming Pronaf program reallocated $20B to agroecological practices, supporting 800,000 family farms and increasing local food sovereignty.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Countries like Costa Rica and Brazil show how redirecting money helped forests grow back and supported small farmers.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 15 (Life on Land) and the Paris Agreement.</p> <h2><a id="knowledge-commons"></a>Knowledge Commons</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Creating open-source platforms and peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges to democratize access to agricultural knowledge, including Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and modern innovations.</p> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Establish 500 community-owned P2P platforms by 2030 to share best practices and TEK.</li> <li>Develop open-source knowledge platforms, training 1 million farmers by 2030 in sustainable practices and technology use.</li> <li>Create TEK repositories with indigenous communities, preserving knowledge for 1,000 communities by 2030.</li></ul> <p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Empowers farmers with accessible, culturally relevant knowledge.</li> <li>Bridges digital divides through low-tech solutions like Short Message Service (SMS) alerts.</li></ul> <p><strong>Success Stories</strong>:</p> <ul><li><em>India</em>: The National Gene Fund preserved 40,000 rice varieties through community seed banks, while Digital Green’s video-based P2P sharing reached 1.5M farmers, reducing pesticide use by 30%.</li> <li><em>Kenya</em>: iCow platform combined local expertise with SMS technology, serving 800,000 farmers and improving dairy yields by 25%.</li> <li><em>Worldwide</em>: Open Source Seed Initiative created networks in 40 countries, protecting 3,000 crop varieties from patent restrictions and increasing seed diversity for 100,000 farmers.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Countries prove sharing local and digital knowledge helps millions of farmers grow better food and protect traditional seeds.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 4 (Quality Education) and UNDRIP.</p> <h2><a id="policy-harmonization"></a>Policy Harmonization</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Aligning national and global policies to create a cohesive framework for sustainable food systems, reducing fragmentation and ensuring accountability.</p> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Harmonize national policies with Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines, the Paris Agreement, and UNDRIP by 2030.</li> <li>Develop model legislation for fair trade and smallholder protections, adopted by 50 nations by 2028.</li> <li>Conduct global audits by an independent body, starting in 2026, to ensure compliance.</li></ul> <p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Creates a unified policy environment that supports equitable trade and sustainable practices.</li> <li>Enhances global cooperation and accountability.</li></ul> <p><strong>Success Stories</strong>:</p> <ul><li><em>African Union</em>: Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) harmonized food policies across 47 countries, mobilizing $65B and reducing hunger by 15%.</li> <li><em>Nordic Council</em>: Unified food policy framework across 5 nations created seamless organic certification, increasing regional trade by 40% and supporting 50,000 sustainable farms.</li> <li><em>ASEAN</em>: Regional food security framework standardized quality standards across 10 countries, facilitating $50B in intra-regional trade and benefiting 2 million smallholders.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: When neighboring countries work together with the same rules, it helps farmers sell their food more easily and fairly.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).</p> <h2><a id="community-co-governance"></a>Community Co-Governance</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Empowering local and indigenous communities to lead decision-making, ensuring food systems reflect cultural and ecological priorities.</p> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Embed indigenous co-governance in steering committees, with 50% representation by 2026.</li> <li>Support 1,000 youth and women-led agricultural initiatives annually to foster inclusive leadership.</li> <li>Facilitate participatory decision-making with 75% consensus requirements, prioritizing marginalized groups.</li></ul> <p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Ensures equitable benefits and cultural relevance in food systems.</li> <li>Builds trust and strengthens community resilience.</li></ul> <p><strong>Success Stories</strong>:</p> <ul><li><em>New Zealand</em>: Māori co-management of fisheries led to sustainable quotas, restored 200,000 hectares of marine ecosystems, and doubled Māori fishing employment to 5,000 jobs.</li> <li><em>Ecuador</em>: Constitutional recognition of indigenous food sovereignty enabled 1,200 indigenous communities to protect 2M hectares of agricultural biodiversity and increase food self-sufficiency by 40%.</li> <li><em>Chile</em>: Participatory budget program allocated $200M to indigenous farming initiatives, supporting 30,000 families in reclaiming ancestral seeds and reducing rural poverty by 25%.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: When indigenous people help make decisions, they protect nature better and strengthen their communities’ food security.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports UNDRIP and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).</p> <h2><a id="visual"></a>Visual: Systemic Leverage Points Network</h2> <p><img
