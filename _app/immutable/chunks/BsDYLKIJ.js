This guide provides step-by-step instructions for indigenous communities to implement community currencies, commons governance, cooperatives, and advocacy campaigns, fostering economic resilience and self-determination. Co-designed with indigenous elders, youth, women, and non-binary individuals, it prioritizes accessibility, cultural integrity, and equitable participation, enabling indigenous communities to contribute to a just and sustainable global economy by 2035.</p> <h2><a id="core-principles"></a>Core Principles</h2> <p>The guide is grounded in indigenous-led principles:</p> <ol><li><strong>Sovereignty</strong>: Indigenous communities control their economic systems, rooted in traditional governance and land stewardship.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Integrity</strong>: Economic initiatives honor indigenous knowledge, languages, and practices, ensuring alignment with community values.</li> <li><strong>Equity</strong>: 50% representation of indigenous women, non-binary individuals, and youth in leadership, prioritizing marginalized voices.</li> <li><strong>Reciprocity</strong>: Economic systems foster mutual benefit, balancing community needs with environmental and social responsibilities.</li> <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Initiatives evolve through community feedback and traditional ecological knowledge, ensuring resilience.</li></ol>

Historical sovereignty conflicts, colonial legacies, and distinct economic traditions may complicate these relationships, but also offer unique opportunities:</p> <h3>Indigenous Monetary Sovereignty Framework</h3> <p>Indigenous communities can draw on their historical and cultural traditions when engaging with monetary authorities:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Historical Monetary Practices</strong>: Document traditional exchange systems (wampum, potlatch, trade networks) as precedents for indigenous monetary sovereignty.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Treaty-Based Approaches</strong>: Where applicable, reference existing treaties that may provide basis for economic self-determination, including monetary aspects.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Cultural Values Integration</strong>: Emphasize how community currencies embody indigenous values (reciprocity, sustainability, community welfare) that align with central bank mandates for economic wellbeing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Parallel Authority Structures</strong>: Position indigenous governance bodies as rightful monetary authorities within traditional territories, seeking nation-to-nation dialogue rather than regulator-to-subject relationships.</p></li></ul> <h3>Practical Engagement Strategies</h3> <p>Indigenous communities can implement specific approaches when engaging monetary authorities:</p> <ol><li><p><strong>Cultural Education Component</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Include educational materials on indigenous economic traditions when engaging central banks.</li> <li>Demonstrate how community currencies represent continuation of historical indigenous exchange systems.</li> <li>Position currency initiatives within broader indigenous economic revitalization.</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Rights-Based Dialogue</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Frame discussions in terms of indigenous rights to economic self-determination.</li> <li>Reference UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) provisions on economic sovereignty.</li> <li>Approach engagement as nation-to-nation rather than as regulated entities.</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Collaborative Models</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Propose joint research on indigenous economic resilience models.</li> <li>Invite central bank representatives to observe traditional economic practices.</li> <li>Develop case studies on how indigenous approaches to community currencies support broader economic stability.</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Strategic Alliance Building</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Partner with indigenous communities in other regions who have successfully navigated central bank relations.</li> <li>Build alliances with sympathetic departments within central banks (e.g., community development, financial inclusion).</li> <li>Engage indigenous economists and financial experts to bridge traditional knowledge and monetary policy understanding.</li></ul></li></ol> <p>Indigenous communities implementing the Tyendinaga Mohawk Currency in Canada and the Lakota Nation with MazaCoin demonstrate how indigenous monetary initiatives can navigate complex sovereignty questions while advancing economic self-determination. By grounding currency projects in cultural traditions and rights-based frameworks, indigenous communities can establish unique relationships with monetary authorities that respect their special legal and historical status.</p>',1);function u(i){var e=a();t(120),n(i,e)}export{u as default,s as metadata};
