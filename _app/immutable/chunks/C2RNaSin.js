When she treats patients, she considers how social determinants of health—poverty, discrimination, environmental degradation—create the conditions she’s addressing in the emergency room. When she advocates for health policy, she thinks about how changes might affect not just her patients but communities worldwide facing similar challenges.</p> <p>Marcus, a software engineer in São Paulo, designs accessibility features not as compliance requirements but as opportunities to include disabled users worldwide in digital experiences. His code becomes a bridge that connects diverse users across cultural and ability differences, embodying global citizenship through technical craftsmanship.</p> <p>These professionals understand a fundamental truth: global citizenship isn’t something you practice after work—it’s how you practice your work. Your career represents one of your most powerful platforms for creating positive change in the world, whether you’re a teacher, engineer, artist, business owner, or public servant. The question isn’t whether your profession can serve global citizenship, but how creatively and effectively you can align your professional capabilities with planetary wellbeing.</p> <h2><a id="beyond-workday"></a>Beyond the Workday: When Purpose Meets Profession</h2> <p>The integration of global citizenship with professional life represents a profound shift from seeing work as separate from values toward recognizing career as one of the primary ways we express our commitment to planetary flourishing. This integration doesn’t require abandoning professional excellence or ignoring economic realities—it means bringing global consciousness to professional decision-making in ways that often enhance rather than compromise career success.</p> <p>When we embody <strong><a href="/frameworks/global-citizenship/full-framework#01-foundational-values">Practice Honesty and Integrity</a></strong> in our professional lives, we discover that aligning work with values creates meaning and motivation that purely transactional approaches to career cannot provide. The lawyer who specializes in human rights law, the engineer who designs sustainable infrastructure, and the teacher who cultivates global competence all report higher job satisfaction and sense of purpose than colleagues who view work primarily as income generation.</p> <blockquote><p>“Your career represents one of your most powerful platforms for creating positive change in the world.”</p></blockquote> <p>Professional integration of global citizenship takes many forms depending on industry context, role responsibilities, and individual circumstances. A marketing professional might focus on authentic representation of diverse communities in campaigns. A logistics coordinator might prioritize suppliers that demonstrate fair labor practices. A financial advisor might specialize in impact investing that aligns client portfolios with global citizenship values.</p> <p>The key insight is that every professional role involves decisions that affect other people—colleagues, customers, communities, and future generations. Global citizenship provides frameworks for making these decisions consciously rather than automatically, with consideration for broader impacts rather than narrow self-interest, and with attention to long-term consequences rather than just immediate results.</p> <p>This conscious decision-making often creates competitive advantages in increasingly global and values-conscious markets. Companies that demonstrate authentic commitment to global citizenship values attract both customers and employees who share those values, creating business benefits that align with moral motivations. Professionals who develop global competencies position themselves for success in international markets and multicultural workplaces.</p> <p><strong>The Ripple Effect of Professional Consciousness</strong></p> <p>When professionals bring global citizenship consciousness to their work, they create ripple effects that extend far beyond their individual contributions. The teacher who incorporates global perspectives into curriculum influences hundreds of students who carry that perspective into their own careers. The manager who implements inclusive hiring practices changes organizational culture in ways that affect all employees and customers.</p> <p>Research consistently demonstrates that professionals with global competencies enhance workplace effectiveness, innovation capacity, and collaborative ability in ways that benefit entire organizations. Unilever’s Global Leadership Development Program provided global citizenship training to 15,000 employees across 190 countries, resulting in 28% improvement in cross-cultural collaboration effectiveness, 35% increase in innovation project success rates, and 42% enhancement in employee retention among program participants.</p> <p>Professional networks amplify individual impact when globally conscious professionals share resources, knowledge, and opportunities across traditional boundaries. Medical professionals who collaborate on global health initiatives, educators who participate in international teaching exchanges, and engineers who work on open-source projects that serve developing communities all demonstrate how professional networking can serve global citizenship while advancing career development.</p> <p>The mentorship and leadership that experienced professionals provide to younger colleagues represents another crucial avenue for multiplying global citizenship impact. When senior professionals model global consciousness and provide guidance for integrating values with career development, they influence the next generation of professional leaders while creating organizational cultures that support rather than discourage values-based practice.</p> <h2><a id="healers-borders"></a>Healers Without Borders: Global Citizenship in Healthcare</h2> <p>Healthcare professionals operate at the intersection of human vulnerability and scientific knowledge, making their work naturally conducive to global citizenship practice through service to human wellbeing that transcends cultural, economic, and political boundaries. The global citizenship value of <strong><a href="/frameworks/global-citizenship/full-framework#01-foundational-values">Act with Compassion</a></strong> finds natural expression in healthcare work that recognizes health as a universal human right rather than a privilege determined by geography or economic status.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Competence as Clinical Excellence</strong></p> <p>Dr. Amira Hassan learned early in her residency that cultural competence wasn’t just politically correct nicety but clinical necessity for providing effective care to diverse patient populations. When she treated elderly Somali refugees for diabetes, she discovered that Western dietary recommendations conflicted with traditional foods that maintained cultural identity and family connection during difficult transitions to new countries.</p> <p>By learning about Somali cuisine and working with community elders to adapt dietary management strategies, Dr. Hassan achieved better patient compliance and health outcomes while demonstrating respect for cultural wisdom about nutrition and healing. Her approach required extra time initially but ultimately proved more efficient than repeatedly treating patients whose cultural needs weren’t addressed through standardized protocols.</p> <p>This experience taught her that global citizenship in healthcare involves understanding how social determinants of health—poverty, discrimination, displacement, environmental degradation—create the conditions that bring patients to healthcare settings. Effective treatment often requires addressing these broader contexts rather than just managing symptoms or acute conditions.</p> <p>Healthcare professionals who develop global consciousness often become advocates for health equity policies that address root causes of illness rather than just providing acute care for symptomatic conditions. They support affordable housing initiatives, environmental protection policies, immigration reform, and economic justice programs as public health interventions that prevent illness more effectively than medical treatment alone.</p> <p><strong>Global Health Partnerships and Knowledge Exchange</strong></p> <p>The most effective global health initiatives involve partnership and knowledge exchange rather than one-way transfer of medical expertise from wealthy to poor communities. Healthcare professionals who practice global citizenship recognize that every community possesses health knowledge and that sustainable health improvements require building local capacity rather than creating dependence on external medical intervention.</p> <p>Partners in Health demonstrates this partnership approach through community health worker programs that train local residents to provide primary healthcare while connecting them with medical professionals for complex cases. This model proves more sustainable and culturally appropriate than sending foreign medical teams for short-term interventions that don’t build lasting local capacity.</p> <p>Traditional medicine integration represents another area where global citizenship enhances healthcare effectiveness by recognizing the value of indigenous healing knowledge while building bridges with contemporary medical practice. Healthcare professionals who learn from traditional healers often discover treatments and approaches that enhance their effectiveness while honoring community healing traditions.</p> <p>Telemedicine and digital health platforms increasingly enable healthcare professionals to provide consultation and support across international boundaries while building relationships with colleagues in different contexts. These platforms work best when they facilitate bidirectional knowledge exchange rather than one-way consultation from wealthy to poor communities.</p> <p>Medical research collaboration that includes diverse populations and addresses health challenges affecting global rather than just wealthy populations demonstrates how healthcare professionals can ensure that medical advances serve universal rather than privileged populations. Global citizenship consciousness motivates participation in research that addresses neglected tropical diseases, maternal mortality, and other health challenges disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.</p> <p><strong>Health Advocacy and Policy Influence</strong></p> <p>Healthcare professionals possess unique credibility and expertise that enables effective advocacy for policies affecting global health and wellbeing. Their professional knowledge provides foundation for evidence-based policy recommendations while their direct experience with patients creates compelling stories that motivate policy change.</p> <p>Climate health advocacy represents a growing area where healthcare professionals apply their understanding of environmental health impacts to advocate for climate action that serves public health. Medical professionals who document connections between air pollution and respiratory illness, heat waves and heat stroke, or extreme weather and mental health provide essential evidence for climate policies while fulfilling their professional responsibilities to promote health.</p> <p>Global health security advocacy involves healthcare professionals in policy discussions about pandemic preparedness, international health coordination, and public health infrastructure that transcends national boundaries. Their expertise proves essential for developing effective responses to health threats that cross borders while ensuring that responses serve rather than ignore vulnerable populations.</p> <p>Health equity advocacy that addresses social determinants of health requires healthcare professionals to engage with housing policy, immigration law, workplace safety regulations, and environmental protection as health issues rather than separate policy domains. This advocacy often proves more effective than clinical treatment for improving population health outcomes.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>In Practice: Healthcare Global Citizenship</strong> <em>Healthcare professionals practice global citizenship by developing cultural competence that enhances clinical effectiveness, participating in global health partnerships that build rather than create dependence, integrating traditional medicine knowledge with contemporary practice, advocating for health equity policies that address social determinants of illness, and supporting health security initiatives that transcend national boundaries while serving vulnerable populations.</em></p></blockquote> <h2><a id="teaching-world"></a>Teaching the World: Educators as Global Citizens</h2> <p>Educators possess extraordinary power to shape how future generations understand their relationship to global community, making education one of the most influential professions for advancing global citizenship values and capabilities. Every teacher decisions about curriculum, classroom culture, and student relationships either contribute to or limit students’ development as global citizens who can engage constructively across differences while addressing shared challenges.</p> <p><strong>Transforming Curriculum Through Global Perspective</strong></p> <p>Maria Santos, a high school history teacher in rural Colorado, initially felt frustrated by curriculum requirements that seemed disconnected from her students’ lives and interests. When she began incorporating global perspectives into American history lessons—showing how local mining operations connected to global economic systems, how immigration patterns reflected international conflicts and opportunities—her students became more engaged while developing understanding of their community’s place in larger global contexts.</p> <p>She discovered that global citizenship education enhanced rather than competed with required curriculum by providing context that made historical events meaningful while developing critical thinking skills that improved academic performance across subjects. Students who understood global economic systems performed better on standardized tests while developing empathy and perspective-taking capabilities that served them in all their relationships.</p> <p>Global competence development happens naturally when educators create classroom environments that mirror the collaborative, multicultural, and problem-solving approaches that global citizenship requires. Group projects that require students to research different cultural perspectives on shared challenges, simulation exercises that enable students to experience different viewpoints, and service learning projects that connect classroom learning to real-world global issues all develop global citizenship capabilities while serving academic objectives.</p> <p>Language education that goes beyond vocabulary and grammar to include cultural competence and global awareness prepares students for international engagement while developing cognitive flexibility and empathy that serves all their learning. Teachers who connect language learning to global issues, cultural exchange, and international collaboration create motivation for language study while building global citizenship capabilities.</p> <p>International partnerships between classrooms provide authentic opportunities for global citizenship development while enhancing academic learning through cross-cultural collaboration. Digital platforms enable students in different countries to work together on shared projects, share different perspectives on global issues, and develop friendships that transcend national boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Creating Inclusive and Globally Conscious Classrooms</strong></p> <p>Educators who practice global citizenship create classroom environments that prepare students for multicultural collaboration while honoring the cultural diversity that students bring to learning. This approach requires moving beyond superficial multiculturalism that treats culture as costume and food toward deep cultural competence that recognizes different knowledge systems and learning styles as resources for enriching education.</p> <p>Culturally responsive pedagogy that builds upon students’ cultural backgrounds while expanding their global awareness creates more effective learning environments than approaches that ignore or try to overcome cultural differences. Teachers who learn about their students’ cultural backgrounds often discover knowledge and perspectives that enhance rather than compete with academic objectives.</p> <p>Anti-bias education that helps students recognize and challenge stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination prepares them for effective global citizenship while creating more inclusive classroom environments for all students. This education works best when it’s integrated throughout curriculum rather than treated as separate programming.</p> <p>Social-emotional learning integration that develops empathy, perspective-taking, and conflict resolution skills provides foundation for global citizenship while improving classroom management and student wellbeing. Students who can regulate their emotions, understand different perspectives, and resolve conflicts constructively are better prepared for both academic success and global citizenship.</p> <p>Restorative justice practices that focus on relationship repair and community healing rather than punishment create classroom cultures that model global citizenship values while addressing behavioral challenges more effectively than punitive approaches.</p> <p><strong>Educator Leadership in Global Citizenship Development</strong></p> <p>Educators often serve as community leaders for global citizenship development by organizing cultural exchange programs, advocating for inclusive education policies, and providing professional development for colleagues interested in incorporating global perspectives into their teaching practice.</p> <p>Professional learning communities that connect educators across cultural and geographic boundaries enable sharing of successful approaches to global citizenship education while building networks that support ongoing development. These communities often prove more effective than formal professional development programs because they’re based on peer relationships and practical problem-solving.</p> <p>Policy advocacy that supports global citizenship education, multicultural curriculum, and international exchange programs enables educators to create systemic change that serves students beyond their individual classrooms. Educators possess unique credibility for education policy advocacy because of their direct experience with student needs and learning processes.</p> <p>Community engagement that connects schools with local and international organizations creates opportunities for authentic global citizenship learning while building community support for educational approaches that prepare students for global engagement rather than just local employment.</p> <p>Teacher exchange programs that enable educators to experience different educational systems and cultural contexts often transform their understanding of teaching and learning while building international networks that support ongoing global citizenship development.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>In Practice: Educational Global Citizenship</strong> <em>Educators practice global citizenship by incorporating global perspectives throughout curriculum rather than treating it as separate subject matter, creating inclusive classroom environments that honor cultural diversity while building global competence, developing international partnerships and exchange opportunities for authentic global learning, practicing culturally responsive pedagogy that builds upon rather than ignores student cultural backgrounds, and engaging in policy advocacy and community leadership that supports global citizenship education.</em></p></blockquote> <h2><a id="building-everyone"></a>Building for Everyone: Engineering with Global Consciousness</h2> <p>Engineers shape the physical and digital infrastructure that determines how billions of people experience daily life, making engineering one of the most globally influential professions despite often being practiced in local contexts. Global citizenship in engineering involves recognizing that technical decisions affect communities worldwide while designing solutions that serve rather than exploit vulnerable populations.</p> <p><strong>Universal Design and Inclusive Innovation</strong></p> <p>Kai Nakamura approaches software engineering with the understanding that accessibility features benefit everyone while ensuring that disabled users aren’t excluded from digital experiences. When he designs voice navigation systems, he considers users who are blind, users with motor disabilities that prevent keyboard use, and users with cognitive differences that make complex interfaces overwhelming, while recognizing that voice interfaces also benefit users multitasking, driving, or working in hands-free environments.</p> <p>His commitment to universal design emerges from global citizenship recognition that technical excellence includes social responsibility. By designing for the margins, he creates better products for everyone while embodying the value of <strong><a href="/frameworks/global-citizenship/full-framework#01-foundational-values">Honor the Life in All Beings</a></strong> through ensuring that technological advancement includes rather than excludes vulnerable populations.</p> <p>This approach requires engineers to understand diverse user contexts rather than designing only for privileged populations with high-end devices, reliable internet connectivity, and advanced technical literacy. Global citizenship consciousness motivates research into user needs across different cultural, economic, and ability contexts while challenging assumptions about “normal” users that exclude majority global populations.</p> <p>Appropriate technology development that creates solutions suited to local contexts and resource constraints demonstrates how engineering can serve global development while building local capacity rather than creating technological dependence. Engineers who work with communities to develop solutions using local materials, skills, and maintenance capabilities often create more sustainable and empowering results than high-tech solutions that require external expertise.</p> <p>Open source development that makes technical innovations freely available demonstrates how engineering can serve global citizenship by sharing knowledge and tools that enable communities worldwide to adapt solutions to their specific needs rather than depending on proprietary technologies controlled by wealthy corporations.</p> <p><strong>Sustainable Engineering and Environmental Responsibility</strong></p> <p>Climate-conscious engineering recognizes that technical decisions affect global environmental systems while developing solutions that mitigate rather than exacerbate environmental degradation. This consciousness influences material choices, energy efficiency priorities, lifecycle assessment practices, and end-of-life disposal planning for engineering projects.</p> <p>Renewable energy engineering that focuses on distributed generation, community ownership, and grid resilience serves both environmental sustainability and energy justice by ensuring that clean energy transitions benefit rather than exclude vulnerable communities. Engineers who work on community solar projects, microgrid development, and energy storage systems demonstrate how technical expertise can serve both environmental and social goals.</p> <p>Water and sanitation engineering that serves communities without reliable access to clean water demonstrates how technical expertise can address global health challenges while building local capacity for system maintenance and improvement. These projects work best when they involve community members in design and implementation rather than imposing external technical solutions.</p> <p>Green building design that considers local climate conditions, cultural preferences, and resource availability while minimizing environmental impact demonstrates how engineering can serve both sustainability and cultural appropriateness. Engineers who learn from traditional building practices often discover more effective solutions than purely contemporary approaches.</p> <p>Circular economy approaches that design products for reuse, repair, and recycling rather than disposability require engineers to consider entire product lifecycles while developing solutions that minimize resource consumption and waste generation throughout global supply chains.</p> <p><strong>Technology for Global Development and Social Justice</strong></p> <p>Engineers who practice global citizenship often focus their technical skills on addressing challenges disproportionately affecting marginalized communities while building solutions that empower rather than exploit vulnerable populations. This focus requires understanding social contexts and power dynamics alongside technical requirements.</p> <p>Communication technology development that serves low-income communities through affordable devices, efficient networks, and appropriate interfaces can bridge digital divides while enabling global connection and economic opportunity. Engineers who design for limited connectivity, older devices, and diverse literacy levels create more inclusive digital experiences.</p> <p>Medical technology innovation that addresses health challenges affecting global rather than just wealthy populations demonstrates how engineering can serve health equity while developing solutions that work in resource-limited settings. This innovation often requires creative approaches to cost reduction, durability enhancement, and user training.</p> <p>Educational technology that serves diverse learning styles, cultural contexts, and resource constraints can expand access to quality education while building local capacity for technology maintenance and content development. Engineers who work with educators and communities often develop more effective solutions than those who design educational technology without educational expertise.</p> <p>Financial technology development that serves unbanked populations through mobile payment systems, microfinance platforms, and cryptocurrency solutions can expand economic opportunity while building financial inclusion for communities excluded from traditional banking systems.</p> <blockquote><p>“Engineers shape the physical and digital infrastructure that determines how billions of people experience daily life.”</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><strong>In Practice: Engineering Global Citizenship</strong> <em>Engineers practice global citizenship by implementing universal design principles that create inclusive rather than exclusive technology solutions, developing appropriate technology that serves local contexts and builds community capacity, prioritizing environmental sustainability and climate consciousness in technical decision-making, focusing technical expertise on challenges affecting marginalized communities and global development, and contributing to open source projects that share technical knowledge for global benefit rather than private profit.</em></p></blockquote> <h2><a id="money-meaning"></a>Money with Meaning: Finance as a Force for Good</h2> <p>Finance professionals wield enormous influence over global resource allocation, making their career choices critical for addressing global inequality, environmental degradation, and economic injustice. Global citizenship in finance involves recognizing money as a tool for creating positive change rather than just generating profit while developing financial systems that serve rather than exploit vulnerable populations.</p> <p><strong>Impact Investing and Values-Aligned Finance</strong></p> <p>Lisa Chen discovered that her MBA in finance could serve global citizenship when she began specializing in impact investing that generates both financial returns and positive social or environmental outcomes. Instead of choosing between profit and purpose, she learned to identify investment opportunities that create competitive returns precisely because they address underserved markets or solve pressing social problems.</p> <p>Her portfolio includes microfinance institutions that provide financial services to unbanked populations, renewable energy projects that create jobs while addressing climate change, and social enterprises that deliver healthcare and education to marginalized communities. These investments often outperform traditional portfolios because they tap into growing markets for sustainable solutions while building resilient business models that serve authentic human needs.</p> <p>Impact measurement becomes essential for ensuring that values-aligned investing creates genuine positive change rather than just marketing claims about social responsibility. Finance professionals who practice global citizenship develop expertise in evaluating social and environmental returns alongside financial returns while holding investees accountable for delivering promised impacts.</p> <p>ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) integration into all investment analysis rather than treating sustainability as separate investment category demonstrates how global citizenship consciousness can transform traditional finance practice. This integration often reveals risks and opportunities that purely financial analysis misses while identifying companies positioned for long-term success in changing global markets.</p> <p>Community development finance that directs capital toward underserved communities through community development financial institutions, loan funds, and place-based investing demonstrates how finance can serve local development while generating reasonable returns for investors committed to community wellbeing.</p> <p><strong>Ethical Banking and Financial Services</strong></p> <p>Banking professionals who practice global citizenship prioritize financial inclusion, fair lending practices, and community development over profit maximization while building financial systems that serve rather than exploit vulnerable populations. This approach often proves profitable because it creates loyal customer relationships and reduces risks associated with predatory practices.</p> <p>Financial literacy education that empowers rather than manipulates customers demonstrates how banking can serve customer wellbeing while building sustainable business relationships. Bankers who help customers understand financial products, avoid debt traps, and build wealth create more valuable long-term relationships than those who maximize short-term transaction fees.</p> <p>Fair lending practices that avoid discrimination while expanding access to credit for underserved populations require finance professionals to challenge biased algorithms and lending criteria while developing alternative approaches to risk assessment that don’t perpetuate historical inequalities.</p> <p>Affordable housing finance that enables homeownership and stable rental housing for low- and moderate-income families demonstrates how banking can address housing inequality while generating stable returns through long-term community relationships.</p> <p>Small business lending that supports entrepreneurship in marginalized communities provides both economic opportunity and community development while creating profitable lending relationships with businesses serving authentic community needs.</p> <p><strong>Global Economic Justice and Policy Advocacy</strong></p> <p>Finance professionals possess expertise and credibility that enables effective advocacy for economic policies that address global inequality while creating more stable and sustainable economic systems. Their professional knowledge provides foundation for evidence-based policy recommendations that serve both economic efficiency and social justice.</p> <p>Tax justice advocacy that supports progressive taxation, corporate accountability, and international cooperation on tax avoidance enables finance professionals to use their expertise for creating more equitable resource distribution while maintaining economic competitiveness.</p> <p>Financial regulation advocacy that protects consumers from predatory practices while maintaining access to legitimate financial services requires finance professionals who understand both market dynamics and consumer protection needs to develop effective policy recommendations.</p> <p>International development finance reform that prioritizes recipient country ownership and sustainable development over donor country interests requires finance professionals who understand both development needs and financial markets to advocate for more effective aid and investment policies.</p> <p>Cryptocurrency and digital finance regulation that protects consumers while enabling financial innovation demonstrates how finance professionals can help shape emerging technologies to serve rather than exploit vulnerable populations.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>In Practice: Financial Global Citizenship</strong> <em>Finance professionals practice global citizenship by specializing in impact investing that generates both financial and social returns, implementing ESG integration throughout investment analysis rather than treating sustainability separately, prioritizing financial inclusion and community development in banking and lending practices, advocating for economic policies that address global inequality and promote financial justice, and developing expertise in measuring social and environmental returns alongside financial performance.</em></p></blockquote> <h2><a id="serving-common-good"></a>Serving the Common Good: Public Service and Governance</h2> <p>Public servants operate at the intersection of policy and practice, making their global citizenship practice essential for creating governance systems that serve rather than ignore global interconnection while addressing local needs through approaches that consider international impacts and opportunities for global cooperation.</p> <p><strong>Multilevel Governance and International Cooperation</strong></p> <p>City Manager Jennifer Rodriguez approaches municipal governance with understanding that local policy decisions affect and are affected by global systems. When developing climate adaptation plans, she collaborates with cities in other countries facing similar challenges while ensuring that local solutions contribute to rather than undermine global climate action.</p> <p>Her approach to economic development prioritizes businesses that demonstrate fair labor practices and environmental sustainability rather than just job creation numbers. This focus attracts businesses committed to long-term community relationships while building economic resilience that serves both local workers and global supply chain sustainability.</p> <p>International cooperation agreements between cities, regions, and other subnational governments demonstrate how public servants can engage in global citizenship through formal diplomatic relationships that address shared challenges while respecting national sovereignty and local self-determination.</p> <p>Sister city relationships that facilitate cultural exchange, economic cooperation, and knowledge sharing enable public servants to learn from governance approaches used elsewhere while building international relationships that serve local development and global understanding.</p> <p>Policy innovation that adapts successful approaches from other contexts while respecting local conditions and preferences demonstrates how public servants can serve global citizenship through evidence-based governance that learns from rather than ignores international experience.</p> <p><strong>Participatory Democracy and Inclusive Governance</strong></p> <p>Public servants who practice global citizenship create governance processes that include rather than exclude marginalized voices while building democratic capacity that serves both local community wellbeing and global citizenship development.
