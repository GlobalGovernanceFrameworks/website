Rooted in historical commons practices, such as the Iroquois Confederacy’s shared language for resource governance and Elinor Ostrom’s precise definitions for commons research, this glossary ensures consistent understanding across different contexts. Drawing on elements from the Core Principles, Governance Structure, and Key Components, it clarifies terms that support participation by stakeholders like Priya, Kwame, and Aroha from User Archetypes. By including cross-commons concepts that connect with environmental and economic systems, the glossary facilitates broader engagement with the framework. The next section, Appendix F: Minimal-Viable Node Quickstart, provides a simplified guide for immediate implementation.</p> <h3><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h3> <p>The Commons Glossary defines key terms used throughout the framework, ensuring clarity for diverse stakeholders from community leaders to policymakers. It aligns with the Core Principles of radical transparency and direct participation by making complex concepts accessible through plain language. With definitions relevant to Governance Structure, Key Components, and Legal Interoperability, this glossary supports stakeholders in implementing the framework. Success would be measured by comprehension (80% of stakeholders understanding key concepts by 2028), accessibility (100 languages supported by 2035), and application (70% of nodes using consistent terminology by 2030). Inspired by Case Studies and User Archetypes, this glossary empowers stakeholders to engage meaningfully with the commons.</p> <h3><a id="technical-terms"></a>Technical Terms</h3> <p>Key technical terms essential for understanding the digital infrastructure and mechanisms of the framework.</p> <p><strong>Blockchain</strong>: A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers, ensuring transparent and tamper-resistant record-keeping for governance decisions and resource allocation in the Digital Commons. In practice, nodes like Lila’s in Canada use blockchain to verify the provenance of Indigenous knowledge, preventing unauthorized modifications.</p> <p><strong>Federated Learning</strong>: A machine learning approach where models are trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, preserving data privacy while enabling collective improvement. This technology allows Aisha’s Senegal node to contribute health data patterns without sharing sensitive individual information.</p> <p><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation</strong>: A cryptographic method allowing multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private, enabling data sharing without privacy breaches. Used by Mei’s Singapore node to aggregate educational outcomes while protecting student identities.</p> <p><strong>Mesh Network</strong>: A decentralized network where devices connect directly to each other without relying on central infrastructure, providing resilient communication even during disruptions. In Bangladesh, Fatima’s node deploys mesh networks to maintain connectivity during monsoons, ensuring 90% uptime.</p> <p><strong>Federated Storage</strong>: A system for distributing data across multiple servers or nodes while maintaining unified access, enhancing security and resilience. Carlos in Brazil uses this to ensure farming app data remains accessible even when some servers are offline.</p> <p><strong>Kill Switch</strong>: A mechanism to disable an AI system if it violates ethical protocols or operates outside defined boundaries, preventing misuse. The AI Governance Board implements these as safeguards for all models in the framework, with 99.9% reliability by 2030.</p> <h3><a id="governance-terms"></a>Governance Terms</h3> <p>Key governance terms related to decision-making structures and processes within the framework.</p> <p><strong>Liquid Democracy</strong>: A governance model combining direct voting with delegable representation, allowing citizens to either vote directly on issues or delegate their vote to trusted representatives. In Priya’s India node, this enables 70% participation in mobility decisions by 2029, as citizens can delegate on technical matters.</p> <p><strong>Holarchic Governance</strong>: A system where authority is distributed across nested, autonomous levels (e.g., nodes, hubs, council) that function both as independent wholes and as parts of larger wholes. The Global Digital Commons Council operates within this structure, balancing local needs with global standards.</p> <p><strong>Citizen Assembly</strong>: A group of randomly selected citizens who deliberate on important issues, providing recommendations through structured dialogue. Regional Digital Hubs convene these for complex decisions, achieving 75% consensus on contentious issues by 2032.</p> <p><strong>Ranked-Choice Voting</strong>: A voting system where voters rank candidates in order of preference, ensuring broader representation and consensus. Used by Regional Hubs to resolve disputes, with 66% consensus required, as demonstrated in the West Africa Hub’s climate data prioritization in 2029.</p> <p><strong>Consensus Decision-Making</strong>: A process seeking the agreement of most participants while addressing the concerns of individuals, prioritizing collaborative solutions. Local Citizen Nodes employ this for community-level governance, requiring 66% approval for proposals.</p> <p><strong>Graduated Sanctions</strong>: A system of escalating penalties for rule violations, proportional to the severity and context of the offense, encouraging compliance while allowing for learning. The AI Governance Board implements these for ethical violations, with 95% resolution at the lowest level by 2032.</p> <h3><a id="legal-and-policy-terms"></a>Legal and Policy Terms</h3> <p>Key legal and policy terms relevant to framework implementation and regulation.</p> <p><strong>Data Sovereignty</strong>: The concept that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the nation or community where it is collected, protecting local control and cultural values. Lila’s Canada node implements this for Indigenous knowledge, with specific protocols recognized in national legislation by 2029.</p> <p><strong>Data Dividends</strong>: Monetary or resource benefits distributed to individuals or communities whose data contributes to value creation, ensuring equitable returns from data exploitation. By 2035, 80% of nodes distribute these to community members, as seen in New Zealand’s cultural preservation initiatives.</p> <p><strong>Open-Source License</strong>: A legal framework allowing software or content to be freely used, modified, and shared, subject to certain conditions that preserve openness. The framework uses Creative Commons and MIT licenses for knowledge and software components, ensuring 90% accessibility by 2032.</p> <p><strong>Digital Ethics Charter</strong>: A declaration of principles governing the ethical use of digital resources, establishing rights and responsibilities for all stakeholders. Regional Hubs adopt these with 75% consensus by 2029, guiding policy decisions across nodes.</p> <p><strong>Compliance Bridge</strong>: A set of protocols and tools that enable alignment between the framework and national or international regulations (e.g., GDPR, LGPD), facilitating legal implementation. Used by 90% of nodes by 2035 to navigate regulatory environments.</p> <p><strong>Data Sovereignty Agreement (DSA)</strong>: A formal compact defining how community data is stored, accessed, and used, emphasizing local control and cultural protocols. Implemented in 95% of nodes by 2032, with specific adaptations for Indigenous communities.</p> <h3><a id="historical-and-conceptual-terms"></a>Historical and Conceptual Terms</h3> <p>Key historical and conceptual terms providing context for the commons approach.</p> <p><strong>Commons</strong>: Shared resources governed by community-defined rules, balancing individual access with collective sustainability. Historically seen in medieval European pastures and Indigenous land management, now extended to digital resources like knowledge, software, and data.</p> <p><strong>Enclosure Movement</strong>: Historical processes where previously shared commons were privatized and commodified, reducing community access and governance, particularly in 16th-19th century England. The Digital Commons Framework counters modern digital enclosure by corporations.</p> <p><strong>Resource Justice</strong>: The equitable distribution of resources, access, and governance power, ensuring benefits flow to all stakeholders, particularly marginalized communities. The framework measures this through reduced digital inequality, targeting top 1% control below 20% by 2040.</p> <p><strong>Commons Tragedy</strong>: Garrett Hardin’s 1968 theory suggesting shared resources inevitably face depletion when individuals pursue self-interest, later challenged by Elinor Ostrom’s work on successful commons governance. The framework incorporates Ostrom’s principles to prevent this outcome.</p> <p><strong>Ubuntu Philosophy</strong>: An African concept emphasizing collective well-being and interconnectedness, captured in the phrase “I am because we are,” informing the framework’s approach to resource sharing. Reflected in the Knowledge Commons’ preservation of diverse cultural expressions.</p> <p><strong>Iroquois Confederacy</strong>: A historic alliance of Native American nations with sophisticated resource governance systems based on consensus and seven-generation sustainability thinking, influencing the framework’s long-term vision and nested governance.</p> <h3><a id="cross-commons-terms"></a>Cross-Commons Terms</h3> <p>Key terms connecting digital commons with environmental and economic systems.</p> <p><strong>Cross-Commons Synergy</strong>: The mutual reinforcement when different commons systems (digital, environmental, economic) interact, creating benefits greater than the sum of their parts. Kwame’s Kenya node demonstrates this through AI farming applications that increase yields by 30% while reducing water usage by 20%.</p> <p><strong>Environmental Stewardship</strong>: The responsible management of digital infrastructure to minimize ecological impacts, including energy efficiency and e-waste reduction. By 2035, 80% of the framework’s infrastructure uses renewable energy, aligned with planetary boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Community Currency</strong>: Local exchange systems, often digitally enabled, that complement national currencies and strengthen local economies, integrated with the Digital Commons through open-source platforms. By 2032, 50% of nodes support these through the Open-Source Software Ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Climate Data Commons</strong>: Shared repositories of climate and environmental information, accessible for research, policy, and community adaptation strategies. The Open Data Commons includes these by 2030, supporting disaster resilience in regions like Bangladesh.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Heritage Preservation</strong>: The digital archiving of cultural knowledge, practices, and artifacts, ensuring their accessibility for future generations while respecting community protocols. New Zealand’s node preserves 500 cultural artifacts by 2031, with youth engagement reaching 50%.</p> <p><strong>Regenerative Economics</strong>: Economic systems that restore rather than deplete natural and social capital, supported by digital commons tools and governance. By 2035, 60% of nodes contribute to local regenerative initiatives through data and software resources.</p>',1);function l(e){var n=s();i(92),o(e,n)}export{l as default};
