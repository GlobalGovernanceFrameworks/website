While no single implementation embodies all framework principles perfectly, each case study shows how specific principles can be applied to address real-world governance challenges.</p> <p>For guidance on implementing these approaches in your own context, see the <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation">Implementation Guidelines</a> section.</p>',1);function d(e){var i=r();o(194),t(e,i)}export{d as default,a as metadata};
