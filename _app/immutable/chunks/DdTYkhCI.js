This section outlines partnership approaches that center community voice, challenge colonial relationships, and foster genuine cooperation based on mutual respect and shared commitment to water justice. By building horizontal networks among the marginalized while engaging powerful actors through principled advocacy, these partnerships demonstrate how global solidarity can serve local liberation.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p>Traditional global partnerships often reproduce colonial relationships where wealthy institutions and governments control resources and decision-making while treating communities as beneficiaries rather than partners. Development partnerships can create dependencies, impose external priorities, and extract knowledge while concentrating benefits in donor countries and international organizations. Transformative partnerships must redistribute power while building genuine solidarity based on mutual learning and shared struggle.</p> <p>This framework establishes partnership approaches that strengthen community autonomy, challenge global power structures, and build solidarity networks that serve water justice rather than institutional interests. Rather than seeking partnerships that extract resources or legitimacy from communities, it fosters relationships that strengthen community capacity while building global movements for systemic change.</p> <p><strong>Core Partnership Principles</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Community Leadership</strong>: Communities as decision-makers rather than beneficiaries in all partnerships</li> <li><strong>Horizontal Solidarity</strong>: Relationships of mutual support rather than charity or development aid</li> <li><strong>Anti-Colonial Practice</strong>: Partnerships that challenge rather than reproduce colonial power relationships</li> <li><strong>Shared Struggle</strong>: Solidarity based on shared commitment to justice rather than institutional interests</li> <li><strong>Resource Redistribution</strong>: Partnerships that redistribute rather than concentrate wealth and power</li></ul> <h2><a id="multi-stakeholder-coordination"></a>Multi-Stakeholder Coordination</h2>
