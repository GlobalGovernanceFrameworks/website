It details measurable milestones across governance, legal, implementation, digital, monitoring, and stakeholder engagement activities to achieve the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035. Rooted in the principles of universal access, rule of law, cultural sensitivity, and transparency, it ensures coordinated progress across diverse jurisdictions.</p> <h3><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h3> <p>The framework’s implementation is structured in four phases over 10 years, balancing rapid foundational work with scalable, sustainable expansion. Each phase includes milestones tied to specific targets, with flexibility for regional adaptation and continuous risk assessment. Stakeholder collaboration and transparent monitoring, as established in prior sections, drive progress, ensuring the framework remains inclusive and resilient. While presented as a linear progression, implementation will include deliberate cycles of evaluation and refinement within each phase, with formal transition reviews between phases to assess readiness for advancement. Critical path milestones are prioritized to prevent delays, supported by contingency buffers and implementation infrastructure.</p> <h3><a id="phase-1-foundation"></a>Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2, 2025-2027)</h3> <p>Establishes governance, legal, and technological foundations, addressing initial political and resource challenges.
