foundation enabling all other framework components to evolve and improve continuously. The Elder Wellbeing Index provides elder-defined success measures while longitudinal research builds the evidence base for effective aging support. Elder co-design ensures evaluation serves community needs while adaptive management enables rapid improvement based on elder feedback.</p> <p>Global learning networks create worldwide knowledge sharing while academic partnerships build research capacity. Together, these systems create evidence-based framework evolution that maintains elder agency while building increasingly effective aging support systems that learn and improve through elder leadership and community wisdom.</p> <p><strong>Next</strong>: Explore how monitoring and evaluation systems support <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/aging#09-call-to-action">Call to Action and Elder Leadership</a> for immediate elder-led initiative development and long-term vision realization.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Implementation Resources</strong>:</p> <ul><li><a href="/frameworks/tools/aging/wellbeing-index-calculator-en.pdf">Elder Wellbeing Index Calculator</a></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/tools/aging/community-evaluation-toolkit-en.pdf">Community Evaluation Toolkit</a></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/tools/aging/research-partnership-template-en.pdf">Research Partnership Agreement Template</a></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/tools/aging/global-learning-network-guide-en.pdf">Global Learning Network Guide</a></li></ul>',1);function u(n){var e=a();o(332),t(n,e)}export{u as default,r as metadata};
