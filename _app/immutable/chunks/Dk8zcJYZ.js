It serves both as a reference for framework participants and as a tool for creating shared understanding across diverse traditions and contexts.</p> <h3>Non-Theistic Spiritualities</h3> <p>Ethical and philosophical systems that emphasize spiritual development, meaning, and values without centering on belief in deities. These include secular Buddhism, philosophical Taoism, some forms of Humanism, Ethical Culture, Modern Stoicism, and similar approaches. These traditions often focus on ethical principles, contemplative practices, and human flourishing without requiring supernatural beliefs.</p> <h3>Indigenous Cosmologies</h3> <p>Holistic worldviews originating from Indigenous peoples that integrate spirituality, ecology, community relationships, and cultural practices into comprehensive understandings of reality. These systems typically view humans as interconnected with all aspects of nature, emphasize responsibility to past and future generations, and maintain knowledge through oral tradition, ritual practices, and lived experience. Examples include Navajo Diné spirituality, Maori tikanga, Lakota traditions, and Aboriginal Dreamtime understandings.</p> <h3>Sub-Category Quotas</h3> <p>Mandated inclusion requirements for diverse sub-groups within traditions to ensure representation beyond dominant voices. These quotas typically address dimensions such as gender, age, denominations/branches, and regional expressions of traditions. For example, requiring that women comprise at least 40% of representatives or that youth (under 30) hold at least 25% of positions.</p> <h3>Epistemic Justice</h3> <p>The fair inclusion and validation of different ways of knowing and understanding reality, particularly those that have been historically marginalized. In the context of the framework, this involves recognizing and respecting diverse approaches to knowledge including revelation, oral tradition, embodied wisdom, contemplative insight, and rational inquiry without privileging one epistemology over others.</p> <h3>Mystical and Transpersonal Epistemologies</h3> <p>Ways of knowing that arise from profound states of consciousness beyond ordinary awareness, including contemplative absorption, unitive experiences, visionary states, entheogenic insights, near-death experiences, and other non-ordinary states of consciousness. These experiential modes of knowledge acquisition are foundational to many spiritual traditions and provide distinctive perspectives on interconnection, ethical relationships, and the nature of reality that can inform governance approaches. While often marginalized in contemporary policy contexts, these epistemologies offer insights particularly relevant to ecological ethics, intergenerational justice, and holistic wellbeing.</p> <h3>Cultural Appropriation</h3> <p>The adoption of elements from a culture or spiritual tradition by members of a different (typically dominant) culture in ways that are exploitative, disrespectful, or fail to acknowledge their origins and significance. The framework explicitly guards against appropriation through protocols ensuring proper attribution, permission, and context when sharing spiritual practices or wisdom.</p> <h3>Transformative Dialogue Protocol</h3> <p>A structured five-stage process designed specifically for addressing historical wounds between traditions:</p> <ol><li>Acknowledgment - Creating space for historical harms to be named</li> <li>Witnessing - Respectful listening without defensive responses</li> <li>Accountability - Concrete actions to address ongoing impacts</li> <li>Reconciliation Rituals - Co-created healing practices respecting all traditions involved</li> <li>Collaborative Future-Building - Joint initiatives focused on shared values</li></ol> <h3>Policy Translation Labs</h3> <p>Structured workshops where spiritual and religious wisdom is translated into practical governance applications through a methodical process including sacred text/tradition analysis, cross-tradition dialogue, collaboration with domain experts, and development of policy frameworks that honor spiritual values while addressing practical governance needs.</p> <h3>Track II Dialogue</h3> <p>Unofficial, informal interactions between members of adversarial groups or nations that aim to develop strategies, influence public opinion, and organize human and material resources in ways that might help resolve conflict. In the framework context, this refers to dialogue conducted through non-governmental channels when official religious engagement is politically sensitive or restricted.</p> <h3>Wisdom Repository</h3> <p>A systematically organized collection of spiritual and religious insights on governance challenges, documented in multiple formats and languages with proper attribution and context. The repository serves as a resource for policymakers, religious leaders, and communities seeking to apply diverse wisdom traditions to contemporary challenges.</p> <h3>Intergenerational Dialogue</h3> <p>Structured exchange between elders and youth within and across traditions, designed to both preserve traditional wisdom and create space for evolving interpretations and applications. These dialogues recognize both the value of established knowledge and the need for adaptation to contemporary contexts.</p> <h3>Ethical Charter</h3> <p>A living document outlining shared values and principles across diverse traditions, focusing on areas of ethical convergence while respecting theological and philosophical differences. The charter provides a foundation for collaborative action without requiring agreement on underlying metaphysical beliefs.</p> <h3>Funding Ethics Committee</h3> <p>A specialized body responsible for reviewing all major funding sources, ensuring donor influence doesn’t compromise representation, developing guidelines for ethical fundraising, and monitoring funding allocation for equity across traditions and regions.</p> <h3>Ombudsman Oversight</h3> <p>Independent third-party review conducted by rotating neutral observers to evaluate regional hubs and governance structures for adherence to core principles, particularly regarding inclusion, transparency, and ethical operation.</p> <h3>Semantic Bridge</h3> <p>A concept, metaphor, or framework that enables communication between different knowledge systems by finding resonance across linguistic and cultural differences. Semantic bridges help translate ideas between traditions without forcing them into a single framework or losing their distinctive nuances.</p> <h3>Knowledge Integration Metrics</h3> <p>Measurements tracking how effectively religious and spiritual insights are being incorporated into other governance domains, including frequency of citation in policy documents, participation rates in cross-domain working groups, policymaker assessments, documented influences, and comparative analysis of governance outcomes.</p> <h3>Digital Literacy for Traditional Leaders</h3> <p>Educational programming specifically designed to help elders and traditional religious authorities effectively engage with digital technologies while respecting their status and learning preferences. These programs focus on practical skills relevant to dialogue participation, tradition preservation, and community connection.</p> <h3>Hybrid Selection Model</h3> <p>The approach used for selecting representatives combining 50% community election (through indigenous institutions or gathered attestations) and 50% nomination by established networks, designed to balance institutional legitimacy with grassroots representation.</p> <h3>Dissolution Clause</h3> <p>A governance mechanism allowing for the disbanding of regional hubs that violate framework principles (through corruption, exclusion, etc.) after formal investigation by a third-party ombudsman, with provisions for redistributing assets to ethical initiatives.</p> <h3>Truth & Reconciliation Branch</h3> <p>A specialized working group focused specifically on acknowledging and healing historical tensions between traditions through structured processes, documentation of multiple perspectives, and development of contextually appropriate reconciliation models.</p> <h3>Parallel Terminology Package</h3> <p>Alternative framing and language for framework activities in politically sensitive contexts, such as using “community cohesion circles” instead of “interfaith dialogue” or “ethical wisdom sharing” instead of “spiritual teaching” where religious expression is restricted.</p> <h3>Ethics-First Approach</h3> <p>A methodology for collaboration that prioritizes shared ethical values and practical outcomes when theological or philosophical agreement is unattainable, allowing traditions to maintain distinctive beliefs while cooperating on common challenges.</p> <h3>Reserve Fund</h3> <p>Financial resources maintained at 20% of annual operating budget to ensure independence during funding transitions, provide stability through funding fluctuations, enable emergency response, and allow the framework to decline problematic funding without compromising operations.</p> <h3>Adaptive Implementation Models</h3> <p>Flexible approaches to framework activities tailored to specific regional contexts, particularly in areas where religious expression is restricted or political sensitivities exist. These models might include virtual-only participation, academic partnerships rather than formal religious engagement, or cultural exchange framing.</p> <h3>Decentralized Traditions</h3> <p>Religious, spiritual, or philosophical communities that lack hierarchical institutional structures but maintain cohesive identity through shared practices, texts, or values. These traditions require alternative verification methods for representative selection, such as community attestation or recognition by practitioner networks.</p> <h3>Regional Hubs</h3> <p>Localized centers implementing the framework’s activities with contextual adaptations, providing culturally appropriate facilitation and translation, connecting local communities with global conversations, and documenting regional wisdom traditions and practices.</p> <p>This glossary is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it remains relevant and accurately reflects the evolving understanding of terms within the framework community.</p>",1);function c(e){var i=o();a(110),n(e,i)}export{c as default};
