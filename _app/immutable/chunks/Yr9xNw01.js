This section defines critical terms, providing both technical explanations and accessible, plain-language descriptions to ensure clarity for diverse stakeholders—farmers, policymakers, indigenous communities, youth, and global partners. These definitions ground the framework’s strategies, from scaling sustainable practices to fostering resilience, in a common language that bridges technical expertise and lived experience.</p> <h2><a id="regenerative-agriculture"></a>Regenerative Agriculture</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Farming practices that restore soil health, enhance biodiversity, and sequester carbon, such as cover cropping, no-till farming, and agroforestry. These methods improve ecosystem functions, increase resilience to climate change, and support long-term agricultural productivity.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Methods to improve land for sustainable farming, making soil healthier, protecting wildlife, and storing carbon to fight climate change.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Regenerative agriculture is central to the framework’s goal of achieving 30% of global farmland under regenerative practices by 2035, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 (Life on Land) and the Paris Agreement.</p> <h3>Visual: Conventional vs. Regenerative Agriculture Practices</h3> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/food-systems/agriculture-comparison-chart.svg" alt="Conventional vs. Regenerative Agriculture Practices"></p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: This comparison chart illustrates the fundamental differences between conventional and regenerative agriculture approaches, emphasizing both practices and their long-term impacts. The visual clearly demonstrates how regenerative methods restore rather than deplete natural resources, aligning directly with the framework’s strategic objectives.</p> <p><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Regenerative practices reduce dependence on external inputs</li> <li>Soil health is actively improved rather than degraded</li> <li>Long-term economic benefits through lower input costs</li> <li>Environmental benefits include carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement</li></ul> <h2><a id="agroecology"></a>Agroecology</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: An approach integrating ecological principles into agriculture, prioritizing local knowledge, biodiversity, and minimal external inputs (e.g., synthetic fertilizers). It emphasizes sustainable, community-driven farming systems that adapt to local ecosystems.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Farming that works with nature, using local wisdom to grow food sustainably with fewer chemicals.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Agroecology underpins the framework’s sustainable practices, supporting the training of 5 million farmers by 2030 and preserving genetic diversity, as outlined in the Strategic Objectives.</p> <h2><a id="food-security"></a>Food Security</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets dietary needs and cultural preferences for an active and healthy life, as defined by the United Nations (UN) Right to Food.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Ensuring everyone has enough safe, healthy, and culturally appropriate food every day.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Food security is a core objective, with the framework targeting a 50% reduction in global hunger by 2030 (SDG 2: Zero Hunger) through enhanced local food systems and equitable trade.</p> <h2><a id="resilience"></a>Resilience</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: The capacity of food systems to adapt to and recover from climate, economic, or social shocks, such as droughts, price spikes, or conflicts, while maintaining functionality and equity.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: The ability of food systems to bounce back from crises, like floods or market crashes, while keeping food available and fair.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Resilience is a guiding principle, embedded in regional customization (e.g., decentralized food hubs) and risk management strategies to address geopolitical and environmental challenges.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: These definitions provide the foundation for the framework’s strategies, detailed in subsequent sections like <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives">Strategic Objectives</a> and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#10-regional-customization">Regional Customization</a>.
