We need new ways of making decisions that consider the wellbeing of all life, not just humans.</p> <h2>The main idea in simple terms</h2> <p>Just as human rights have expanded over time to include all people regardless of race, gender, or other differences, we can expand our understanding of rights to include other beings that can experience life in meaningful ways.</p> <h2>Understanding different worldviews</h2> <h3>What is the “Spiral-Aware” approach?</h3> <p>People and cultures see the world differently based on their experiences, values, and stage of development. Instead of forcing everyone to think the same way, this framework works with these differences while encouraging growth toward more inclusive perspectives.</p> <p><strong>Think of it like this</strong>: Some people focus on survival and security, others on success and achievement, others on fairness and equality, and still others on understanding whole systems. All of these perspectives have value, and the framework speaks to each one while inviting expansion.</p> <h3>Different stages of understanding</h3> <p><strong>Security-focused people</strong> might think: “How does this keep my family and community safe?” <strong>Success-focused people</strong> might ask: “How does this help us achieve our goals and prosper?” <strong>Fairness-focused people</strong> might wonder: “How does this create justice for everyone?” <strong>Systems-focused people</strong> might consider: “How does this help everything work together sustainably?”</p> <p><strong>The framework respects all these questions</strong> and provides answers that make sense from each perspective.</p> <h3>Why this matters</h3> <p>Rather than dismissing people who think differently, the framework:</p> <ul><li>Meets people where they are in their understanding</li> <li>Shows how expanded ethics can align with their existing values</li> <li>Creates pathways for gradually expanding compassion and consideration</li> <li>Builds bridges between different worldviews</li></ul> <h2>How this shows up throughout the framework</h2> <h3>Color references you might see</h3> <p>Throughout the framework, you might see references to different “colors” or “stages.” These aren’t judgments about better or worse—they’re just different ways of understanding the world:</p> <ul><li><strong>Blue</strong> (order-focused): Values rules, traditions, and clear authority</li> <li><strong>Green</strong> (equality-focused): Emphasizes fairness, inclusion, and community</li> <li><strong>Yellow</strong> (systems-focused): Sees complex interconnections and multiple perspectives</li> <li><strong>Turquoise</strong> (holistic): Integrates all perspectives in service of the whole</li></ul> <h3>Practical application</h3> <p>When implementing the framework:</p> <ul><li><strong>Blue communities</strong> might emphasize clear laws and proper procedures</li> <li><strong>Green communities</strong> might focus on inclusive decision-making and social justice</li> <li><strong>Yellow approaches</strong> might use adaptive systems and multiple viewpoints</li> <li><strong>Turquoise integration</strong> might combine all approaches as appropriate</li></ul> <h2>Examples of spiral-aware thinking</h2> <h3>Animal rights</h3> <p><strong>Security perspective</strong>: “Protecting animals prevents disease outbreaks and maintains stable food systems” <strong>Success perspective</strong>: “Ethical animal treatment creates better products and stronger businesses” <strong>Fairness perspective</strong>: “Animals deserve protection from suffering because it’s the right thing to do” <strong>Systems perspective</strong>: “Healthy animal populations support ecosystem balance that benefits everyone”</p> <h3>Environmental protection</h3> <p><strong>Security perspective</strong>: “Clean air and water keep our families healthy” <strong>Success perspective</strong>: “Sustainable practices create long-term economic opportunities” <strong>Fairness perspective</strong>: “Everyone deserves access to a healthy environment” <strong>Systems perspective</strong>: “Human wellbeing depends on healthy ecosystems”</p> <h3>Technology ethics</h3> <p><strong>Security perspective</strong>: “AI systems should be safe and controllable” <strong>Success perspective</strong>: “Ethical AI development attracts talent and investment” <strong>Fairness perspective</strong>: “AI should serve everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful” <strong>Systems perspective</strong>: “AI development should consider impacts on all beings and future generations”</p> <h2>Why this approach works</h2> <h3>Builds bridges instead of walls</h3> <p>Instead of creating conflict between different perspectives, the spiral-aware approach:</p> <ul><li>Finds common ground in shared values</li> <li>Shows how expanded ethics can serve everyone’s interests</li> <li>Reduces resistance by speaking to people’s existing concerns</li> <li>Creates coalition-building opportunities across different worldviews</li></ul> <h3>Enables sustainable change</h3> <p>Change that works with people’s values rather than against them is more likely to:</p> <ul><li>Gain widespread acceptance</li> <li>Survive political and social changes</li> <li>Adapt to different cultural contexts</li> <li>Create lasting transformation rather than temporary compliance</li></ul> <h3>Honors human diversity</h3> <p>The approach recognizes that:</p> <ul><li>Different cultures and communities may emphasize different values</li> <li>Individuals are at different stages of moral development</li> <li>Various perspectives each contribute important insights</li> <li>Growth happens gradually through invitation rather than force</li></ul> <h2>Questions this helps answer</h2> <ul><li>Why don’t we just tell everyone what’s right and expect them to follow it?</li> <li>How do we work with people who have very different values?</li> <li>What if my culture or community sees things differently?</li> <li>How do we create change without forcing our views on others?</li> <li>Why do different parts of the framework speak to different concerns?</li></ul> <h2>Important words explained</h2> <ul><li><strong>Spiral-Aware</strong>: An approach that recognizes and works with different worldviews and developmental stages</li> <li><strong>Worldview</strong>: The basic way someone understands life, values, and how the world works</li> <li><strong>Developmental stages</strong>: Different levels of complexity in how people and cultures approach problems</li> <li><strong>Integration</strong>: Bringing together different perspectives in a way that honors all of them</li> <li><strong>Cultural adaptation</strong>: Modifying approaches to work within different cultural contexts</li></ul> <h2>Learn more</h2> <ul><li><a
