These principles shape every strategy, from scaling regenerative agriculture to fostering inclusive stakeholder engagement, ensuring alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines. For farmers, indigenous communities, youth, and policymakers, these principles provide a shared foundation to co-create a nourishing future.</p> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/food-systems/core-principles-diagram.svg" alt="Core Principles Interconnection"></p> <h2><a id="sustainability"></a>Sustainability</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Promoting agricultural practices that restore ecosystems, preserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change, ensuring long-term food production without depleting natural resources.</p> <p><strong>Application</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Scale regenerative agriculture to 30% of global farmland by 2035, using practices like cover cropping and agroforestry.</li> <li>Support genetic diversity by preserving 1,000 crop varieties through seed banks by 2030.</li> <li>Achieve 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) sequestration annually by 2035, aligning with the Paris Agreement.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Growing food in ways that protect nature, improve soil, and fight climate change for future generations.</p> <h2><a id="equity"></a>Equity</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Ensuring fair access to resources, markets, and benefits for all stakeholders, with particular emphasis on marginalized groups such as smallholder farmers, women, youth, indigenous communities, and refugees, respecting indigenous rights per UNDRIP.</p> <p><strong>Application</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Embed indigenous co-governance in decision-making, with 50% representation in governance bodies by 2026.</li> <li>Promote fair trade certification for 50% of global agricultural exports by 2035.</li> <li>Support 1,000 youth and women-led agricultural initiatives annually to empower underrepresented groups.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Making sure everyone, especially those often left out, gets fair opportunities and benefits from food systems.</p> <h2><a id="resilience"></a>Resilience</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Building food systems capable of adapting to and recovering from climate, economic, or social shocks, such as droughts, price volatility, or conflicts, while maintaining equitable access and functionality.</p> <p><strong>Application</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Establish decentralized food hubs to maintain supply chains during crises, targeting 30% local sourcing by 2030.</li> <li>Develop early warning systems and crop insurance for 50% of smallholders by 2030.</li> <li>Deploy low-tech solutions (e.g., Short Message Service [SMS] alerts) to bridge digital gaps, reaching 1 million farmers by 2030.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Creating food systems that stay strong and fair even during tough times like floods or wars.</p> <h2><a id="transparency"></a>Transparency</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Fostering accountability and trust in food supply chains and policy processes through open data, public reporting, and inclusive decision-making.</p> <p><strong>Application</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Implement blockchain for supply chain transparency, tracking 25% of global trade by 2035, with safeguards against data misuse.</li> <li>Publish biannual compliance dashboards to report policy alignment and mediation outcomes.</li> <li>Use participatory decision-making with 75% consensus requirements to ensure stakeholder trust.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Keeping food systems open and honest, so everyone knows what’s happening and can trust the process.</p> <h2><a id="navigating-principle-tensions"></a>Navigating Principle Tensions</h2> <p>Inevitably, implementation will encounter situations where principles may seem to conflict. The framework addresses these through:</p> <p><strong>Example Tensions & Resolutions</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Transparency vs. Privacy</strong>: When blockchain tracking could reveal sensitive farmer data, we implement “privacy-preserving transparency” - aggregated data for accountability without individual exposure.</li> <li><strong>Equity vs. Efficiency</strong>: If rapid scaling bypasses thorough consultation, we slow implementation to ensure inclusive participation, recognizing that sustainable progress requires all voices.</li> <li><strong>Resilience vs. Costs</strong>: When expensive technologies could enhance resilience but exclude smallholders, we prioritize accessible solutions like hybridized TEK-tech approaches.</li></ul> <p><strong>Resolution Mechanisms</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Steering Committee review using the 75% consensus requirement</li> <li>Mediation panels for complex conflicts</li> <li>Regular principle alignment audits to ensure no single principle dominates</li></ul> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: These core principles guide the framework’s <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives">Strategic Objectives</a> and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement">Stakeholder Engagement</a>.
