This comprehensive ethical framework ensures that health technology development serves justice, equity, and planetary well-being while respecting diverse cultural values and maintaining community sovereignty over technological implementation. All technology governance mechanisms prioritize precautionary principles, community consent, and the understanding that technological power must be democratically controlled.</p> <h2><a

Charter</strong> demonstrates community-accountable AI governance. Launched in 2020, the charter requires government agencies to assess algorithmic impact on citizens, with particular attention to Māori communities and Treaty of Waitangi obligations. The charter includes public consultation requirements, bias testing, and cultural competency assessments. During COVID-19, algorithmic contact tracing systems were designed with Māori data sovereignty principles and community oversight, ensuring technology served equity rather than surveillance. This model shows how indigenous sovereignty can guide ethical technology governance.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: The <strong>Global South AI Sovereignty Alliance</strong> (2026-2029) successfully established community-controlled AI governance across 40 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Traditional knowledge holders worked with AI developers to create culturally appropriate health AI systems, while community technology assemblies governed AI deployment with democratic oversight. Traditional healing diagnostic methods were integrated with AI systems, improving accuracy by 45% while preserving indigenous knowledge sovereignty. Youth technology advocates trained in both traditional knowledge and modern AI ethics became global leaders in ethical technology governance, creating a model for democratic technology control worldwide.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: This ethical technology governance framework integrates with <a href="#algorithmic-bias-audits-fairness">Algorithmic Bias Audits and Fairness</a>, <a href="#community-technology-sovereignty">Community Technology Sovereignty</a>, <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#02-technology-data-infrastructure">Technology and Data Infrastructure</a> for AI bias auditing and community oversight, and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#01-governance-structure">Governance Structure</a> for democratic technology oversight and community representation in global health technology governance.</p>',1);function m(i){var t=r();o(174),e(i,t)}export{m as default,a as metadata};
