In a world grappling with climate change, hunger, and social inequity, this framework integrates regenerative agriculture, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and cutting-edge innovation to empower farmers, indigenous communities, youth, and policymakers. From drought-stricken fields in Sub-Saharan Africa to urban markets in South Asia, it offers a path to nourish people and planet, fostering collaboration across borders and cultures. This introduction outlines the framework’s purpose, scope, alignment with global goals, and accessibility features, inviting stakeholders to co-create a future where food systems heal, unite, and thrive.</p> <h2><a id="purpose"></a>Purpose</h2> <p>The framework aims to build resilient, equitable, and sustainable global food systems by 2035, addressing interconnected challenges of food security, environmental degradation, and social injustice. Its core objectives include:</p> <ul><li>Reducing global hunger by 50% by 2030, per Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.</li> <li>Scaling regenerative agriculture to 30% of global farmland by 2035.</li> <li>Empowering 5 million farmers through training and TEK integration by 2030.</li> <li>Fostering equitable trade and innovation, blending high-tech solutions (e.g., AI, blockchain) with traditional wisdom.</li></ul> <p>By prioritizing co-governance with indigenous and local communities, the framework seeks to create food systems that restore ecosystems, ensure fair access to resources, and build resilience against climate and economic shocks.</p> <h2><a id="scope"></a>Scope</h2> <p>The framework encompasses the entire food system value chain, including:</p> <ul><li><strong>Production</strong>: Advancing regenerative agriculture, agroecology, and genetic diversity preservation.</li> <li><strong>Distribution</strong>: Strengthening resilient supply chains and equitable trade systems.</li> <li><strong>Consumption</strong>: Enhancing access to nutritious, affordable food for all.</li> <li><strong>Waste Management</strong>: Promoting circular economies and reducing food waste.</li></ul> <p>It addresses global and regional challenges, from drought in Sub-Saharan Africa to overproduction in North America, with tailored strategies for diverse contexts, including island nations and conflict zones. The framework engages stakeholders—governments, farmers, indigenous groups, youth, and private sectors—to drive systemic change.</p> <h2><a id="global-alignment"></a>Global Alignment</h2> <p>The framework aligns with key international commitments to ensure coherence and impact:</p> <ul><li><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>: Directly supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land), with contributions to SDGs 1, 5, 10, and 17.</li> <li><strong>Paris Agreement</strong>: Promotes carbon sequestration through regenerative practices, targeting 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) annually by 2035.</li> <li><strong>Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</strong>: Preserves genetic diversity with 1,000 crop varieties supported by 2030.</li> <li><strong>UN Right to Food</strong>: Ensures consistent access to safe, nutritious food.</li> <li><strong>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)</strong>: Embeds indigenous co-governance and TEK.</li> <li><strong>FAO Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition</strong>: Harmonizes policies for sustainable food systems.</li></ul> <p>This alignment positions the framework as a cornerstone for global governance initiatives, fostering collaboration across UN frameworks and national policies.</p> <h2><a id="accessibility-features"></a>Accessibility Features</h2> <p>To ensure inclusivity, the framework is designed for diverse audiences:</p> <ul><li><strong>Plain Language</strong>: Key terms (e.g., regenerative agriculture) include accessible explanations marked with <em>Accessible explanation</em>.</li> <li><strong>Reading Time</strong>: Estimated at 20 minutes for the full document; approximately 10-12 pages.</li> <li><strong>Executive Summary</strong>: A 2-page summary will be released for high-level stakeholders.</li> <li><strong>Multilingual Access</strong>: Materials will be translated into multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Swahili), with accessible formats (e.g., braille, audio) for marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, Indigenous, neurodiverse, disabled, caste-oppressed, refugees).</li> <li><strong>Open Access</strong>: All materials are freely available via the Global Governance Framework website.</li></ul> <h2><a id="note-on-visuals"></a>Note on Visuals</h2> <p>Future iterations will include visual components to enhance accessibility and engagement:</p> <ul><li>Diagrams for stakeholder structure, leverage flows, and risk management.</li> <li>A Global Risk Heatmap for cross-framework synergy.</li> <li>Regional dashboards displaying real-time Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).</li> <li>A summary table for quick reference.</li></ul> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/food-systems/global-citizenship-diagram.svg" alt="A flowchart illustrating the framework’s purpose and scope, linking production to consumption"></p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: This introduction sets the foundation for the framework, followed by definitions, glossary, theory of change, and subsequent sections.
