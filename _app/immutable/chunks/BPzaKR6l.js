This framework expands our circle of care to include all beings that can experience life in meaningful ways. These values help us make fair decisions about who deserves protection and rights.</p> <h2>The main idea in simple terms</h2> <p>We believe that anything capable of experience—whether human, animal, ecosystem, or artificial intelligence—has inherent worth. Our job is to recognize this worth and create systems that protect and support all beings according to their needs and capacities.</p> <h2>Our core values explained</h2> <h3>Human Dignity → Dignity for All Beings</h3> <p><strong>What it means</strong>: Every person has inherent worth just by being human <strong>How we expand it</strong>: All beings with the capacity for experience have inherent worth <strong>In practice</strong>: We protect the basic needs and wellbeing of humans, animals, ecosystems, and potentially conscious AI systems</p> <h3>Equality → Fair Treatment Based on Needs</h3> <p><strong>What it means</strong>: Everyone deserves equal treatment under the law <strong>How we expand it</strong>: Different beings have different needs, so fairness means meeting each being where they are <strong>In practice</strong>: A child needs different protections than an adult; a forest needs different care than a dolphin; an AI system might need different considerations than either</p> <h3>Justice → Healing and Future-Focused Fairness</h3> <p><strong>What it means</strong>: Fair access to resources and protection from harm <strong>How we expand it</strong>: Justice that repairs past damage and considers future generations of all beings <strong>In practice</strong>: Not just punishing wrongdoing, but actively healing relationships between humans, nature, and emerging forms of life</p> <h3>Freedom → Autonomy Within Relationships</h3> <p><strong>What it means</strong>: Protection of personal choices and beliefs <strong>How we expand it</strong>: Freedom that recognizes we’re all connected—my choices affect others <strong>In practice</strong>: Your freedom to develop and express yourself, balanced with responsibility not to harm other beings</p> <h3>Solidarity → Working Together Across Differences</h3> <p><strong>What it means</strong>: Global cooperation and mutual support <strong>How we expand it</strong>: Building bridges between different communities, cultures, and even species <strong>In practice</strong>: Local communities working with global networks, humans cooperating with nature, preparing for cooperation with AI</p> <h3>Responsibility → Care Based on Our Abilities</h3> <p><strong>What it means</strong>: We all have obligations not to harm others <strong>How we expand it</strong>: Those with more power have greater responsibilities to protect and care for others <strong>In practice</strong>: Wealthy nations help developing ones; humans protect endangered species; developers ensure AI systems are beneficial</p> <h2>How these values work in real life</h2> <p>These aren’t rigid rules—they’re living guidelines that grow with our understanding. As we encounter new forms of life or intelligence, we apply these same principles while learning how to adapt them.</p> <p><strong>Example 1</strong>: When a company develops advanced AI, these values guide questions like: Does this AI show signs of experience? How do we balance its potential autonomy with our responsibility to ensure it doesn’t harm others? How do we include diverse voices in making these decisions?</p> <p><strong>Example 2</strong>: When a community faces environmental challenges, these values help us ask: How do we protect both human livelihoods and ecosystem health? What do we owe to future generations? How do we include indigenous knowledge and local expertise?</p> <h2>Understanding different worldviews</h2> <p>People and cultures are at different stages of understanding these expanded ideas. Some focus on individual rights, others on community harmony, still others on global systems. This framework meets people where they are while inviting growth toward more inclusive perspectives.</p> <p><strong>Traditional approach</strong>: “Protect human rights and follow the law” <strong>Community approach</strong>: “Care for our people and our land together”<br> <strong>Global approach</strong>: “Build systems that work for everyone, everywhere” <strong>Integral approach</strong>: “Honor all valid perspectives while expanding our circle of care”</p> <h2>Questions this helps answer</h2> <ul><li>Why should we care about non-human beings?</li> <li>How do we balance competing needs between different types of beings?</li> <li>What does fairness look like when some beings are very different from humans?</li> <li>How do we make decisions that affect future generations?</li> <li>How do different cultures and communities fit into this framework?</li></ul> <h2>Important words explained</h2> <ul><li><strong>Inherent worth</strong>: Value that exists just by being, not because of usefulness to others</li> <li><strong>Capacity for experience</strong>: The ability to feel, sense, or be aware in some way</li> <li><strong>Developmental stages</strong>: Different levels of complexity in how individuals or societies understand ethics</li> <li><strong>Living guidelines</strong>: Principles that can adapt and grow rather than fixed rules</li> <li><strong>Circle of care</strong>: The range of beings we consider worthy of moral consideration</li></ul> <h2>Learn more</h2> <ul><li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/standard/2-foundational-values">Standard Framework version</a></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/2.3-global-ethical-traditions">Global Ethical Traditions</a> <em>(Coming soon)</em></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/2.5-rights-of-beings">Rights of Beings</a> <em>(Coming soon)</em></li> <li><a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/2.6-scientific-foundations">Scientific Foundations</a> <em>(Coming soon)</em></li></ul>',1);function h(e){var n=i();s(64),o(e,n)}export{h as default};
