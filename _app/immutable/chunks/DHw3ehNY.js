Others, tradition. Others, freedom. Others, systems thinking.<br> If we want to create <strong>universal ethics</strong>, we must understand these <strong>worldview layers</strong>.</p> <hr> <h3>🔑 The Spiral at a Glance</h3> <p><em>A developmental map of worldviews and how they perceive rights</em></p> <p>Each stage is a way of making sense of the world—a lens, a song, a dance with reality.
No stage is better—just more encompassing, more entangled in complexity, depth, and subtlety.</p> <p>Early stages see rights as survival tools, as protections from harm.
Later stages as contracts, as bridges of fairness and freedom.
In the transpersonal realms, rights soften into invitations, dissolutions, and finally, radiant being itself—where no rights are needed, because no separation remains.</p> <p>This is not a hierarchy of worth, but a spiral of unfolding perspectives—each with its wisdom, its blind spots, its gifts.</p> <table><thead><tr><th><strong>Color</strong></th><th><strong>Core Drive</strong></th><th><strong>Rights View</strong></th><th><strong>Key Phrase</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>🟤 Beige</td><td>Survival Instincts</td><td>No concept of rights—pure need and reaction</td><td><em>“Eat.
