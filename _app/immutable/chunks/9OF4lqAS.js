CDC)</strong>, established in 2017, demonstrates successful regional health coordination. During COVID-19, Africa CDC coordinated continent-wide responses, including the Partnership to Accelerate COVID-19 Testing (PACT) initiative, which established testing strategies adapted to African contexts. This example shows how regional health coordination can maintain local relevance while achieving continental-scale impact.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: In the <strong>Pacific Health Sovereignty Initiative</strong> (2028-2030), Pacific Island nations established the first Regional Health Hub with full indigenous co-governance. Traditional Polynesian, Melanesian, and Micronesian healing practices were integrated with modern healthcare delivery through Community Health Legions trained in cultural protocols. The initiative achieved 40% reduction in diabetes complications and 60% improvement in maternal health outcomes while preserving traditional knowledge systems.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: This governance structure integrates with <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#02-technology-data-infrastructure">Technology and Data Infrastructure</a> for digital democracy tools, <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#03-financing-mechanisms">Financing Mechanisms</a> for resource allocation oversight, and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#06-community-centered-healthcare">Community-Centered Healthcare Delivery</a> for Community Health Legion coordination.</p>',1);function d(e){var i=a();o(216),n(e,i)}export{d as default,r as metadata};
