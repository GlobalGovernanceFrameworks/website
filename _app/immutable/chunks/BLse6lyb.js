These assemblies are supported with educational resources and expert testimony to facilitate informed deliberation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stratified Random Selection</strong>: Participant selection methods that ensure demographic representativeness across age, gender, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and cultural background.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Youth and Elder Representation</strong>: Guaranteed participation of both younger and older generations to ensure intergenerational perspectives are incorporated into rights governance.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Accessibility Mandate</strong>: All participation mechanisms must include accommodations for linguistic, economic, and ability-based barriers to ensure marginalized communities can meaningfully engage in decision-making processes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Non-Human Representation</strong>: Specialized protocols for incorporating the interests of non-human rights-holders through scientific assessment, cultural knowledge, and designated guardians who can advocate on their behalf.</p></li></ul> <p>These inclusive governance mechanisms recognize that ethical decision-making requires diverse perspectives and direct participation from those most affected by outcomes.</p>",1);function m(e){var i=s();a(8),t(e,i)}export{m as default,o as metadata};
