Extend early phases to allow benefit accumulation before expansion</li> <li><strong>Volunteer Capacity</strong>: Adjust milestone pacing to match available weekly hours</li> <li><strong>Technical Barriers</strong>: Extend timeframes for digital components while starting with analog systems</li> <li><strong>Geographic Challenges</strong>: Add time for physical gathering phases in isolated areas</li> <li><strong>Institutional Limitations</strong>: Extend timeframes when formal support is limited or absent</li></ul> <p>By following this minimum viable implementation timeline, resource-constrained actors can establish functioning framework components with minimal initial investment, building capacity through demonstrated benefits rather than requiring significant upfront resources. This approach ensures accessibility across diverse contexts while maintaining alignment with framework principles.</p> <h2><a id="tools"></a>Tools</h2> <p>The Economic Integration Seed Kit provides
