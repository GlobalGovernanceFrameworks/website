Cuba’s comprehensive approach includes community evacuation planning, pre-positioned medical supplies, and traditional knowledge integration for post-disaster recovery. During Hurricane Irma (2017), Cuba evacuated 1.7 million people with zero deaths, maintaining health service delivery throughout the crisis. Community health workers coordinated with traditional healers and neighborhood committees, ensuring culturally appropriate care and community resilience. This model shows how community organization and traditional knowledge enhance modern emergency preparedness.</p> <p><strong>Case Study (Fictive)</strong>: The <strong>Pacific Islander Climate Health Alliance</strong> (2028-2032) successfully integrated traditional navigation knowledge with satellite-based early warning systems across 20 island nations. Traditional weather forecasters worked with meteorologists to predict climate health threats, while community health workers trained in both modern and traditional healing practices provided culturally appropriate care during climate emergencies. Coral reef restoration projects reduced storm surge impact while providing traditional medicine resources, creating community-controlled resilience systems that protected both human and ecosystem health during increasing climate extremes.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Cross-Reference Note</strong>: This preparedness framework integrates with <a href="#one-health-surveillance-systems">One Health Surveillance Systems</a>, <a href="#emergency-response-infrastructure">Emergency Response Infrastructure</a>, <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#06-community-centered-healthcare">Community-Centered Healthcare Delivery</a> for Community Health Legion emergency training, and <a href="/frameworks/docs/implementation/planetary-health#02-technology-data-infrastructure">Technology and Data Infrastructure</a> for AI-powered outbreak prediction and community-controlled surveillance systems.</p>',1);function h(e){var n=r();a(176),i(e,n)}export{h as default,o as metadata};
