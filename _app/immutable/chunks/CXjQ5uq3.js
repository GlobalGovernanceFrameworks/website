indices).</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Develop real-time data platforms with region-specific dashboards (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa drought resilience dashboard) updated annually.</li> <li>Conduct annual evaluations, with a mid-term review in 2027, to refine strategies.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Measure progress with numbers (like farmland improved) and feelings (like trust) to keep the plan on track.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 2 and SDG 15 (Life on Land).</p> <h2><a id="digital-infrastructure-timeline"></a>Digital Infrastructure Timeline</h2> <p><strong>Digital Infrastructure Timeline</strong>:</p> <ul><li>2025: Establish 10 regional data centers with offline-first architecture</li> <li>2026: Deploy satellite connectivity to 1,000 rural communities</li> <li>2027: Launch hybrid platforms serving 100% offline capabilities</li> <li>2028: Integrate AI-predictive models with 50% processing occurring locally</li> <li>2030: Achieve interoperability between all national monitoring systems</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Build a step-by-step plan to bring technology to everyone, starting with simple offline systems.</p> <h2><a id="conflict-resolution"></a>Conflict Resolution</h2> <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Address disputes fairly to maintain collaboration.</p> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Establish 20 tailored mediation panels by 2026, using Consensus Building Institute protocols, to resolve conflicts (e.g., agribusiness vs. small farmers).</li> <li>Implement participatory decision-making with 75% consensus requirements, prioritizing input from youth, indigenous, and refugee stakeholders.</li> <li>Publish mediation outcomes on biannual public dashboards to ensure transparency.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Set up fair ways to solve disagreements, making sure everyone’s voice is heard and results are shared openly.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).</p> <h2><a id="capacity-building"></a>Capacity Building</h2> <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Equip stakeholders with skills and resources for sustainable practices.</p> <p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Train 5 million farmers and 10,000 policymakers on regenerative agriculture and TEK by 2030, with tailored modules for women and youth.</li> <li>Support 1,000 youth and women-led agricultural initiatives annually, providing grants and mentorship.</li> <li>Develop training hubs in 50 regions by 2028, integrating low-tech (e.g., radio) and high-tech (e.g., e-learning) delivery.</li></ul> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Teach millions of farmers and leaders how to farm sustainably, with special support for women and youth.</p> <p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality).</p> <h2><a
