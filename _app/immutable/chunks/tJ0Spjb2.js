It includes visual aids, toolkits, glossaries, and engagement guides to empower stakeholders—policymakers, legal practitioners, indigenous communities, youth, and civil society—in achieving the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035. Rooted in the principles of universal access, rule of law, cultural sensitivity, and transparency, these resources ensure practical, inclusive, and adaptable support for global justice.</p> <h3><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h3> <p>The Appendices serve as a practical companion to the framework, providing tools and references to operationalize its components. From visual timelines illustrating critical milestones to toolkits for pilot projects, these resources are designed for diverse audiences, including jurisdictions with varying capacities. Accessible via the framework’s digital repository and offline formats, they support the collaborative and transparent implementation process outlined across the framework, ensuring stakeholders have the means to succeed. These resources are not static—they will evolve based on implementation experience and stakeholder feedback, with regular updates and additions as the framework progresses through its implementation phases. A flagship “Start Here” guide orients new users, while prioritization guidance and community contributions ensure relevance and ownership.</p> <h3><a id="visual-aids"></a>Visual Aids</h3> <p>Visual
